6210398,Gary Comer Middle School,Chromebook distribution,"Jasmynn:

Thanks for meeting with me -- I'm glad to hear you are feeling better.

Here's what we have:


   - The communication I sent to staff is HERE
   <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wKXlVqxOWfdfbGaEFpH_-cKLX6eeyIgZgHPFaIMMsgA/edit?usp=sharing>
   - The communication I sent to parents is HERE
   <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ezvry4Ziv008Hxg2tDlvb3oAzV8X8e4mgmOIeTV6jSg/edit?usp=sharing>
   - The revised distribution calendar (still tentative) is HERE
   <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IaU5RlMgY65C9LUhXFRqfcQ19HMah0K_FS8ROGB6N3I/edit?usp=sharing>.
   I went 8th grade, then 6th, then 7th, but I pushed the rooms that don't
   currently have carts to the back end of the list. That would be Dunlap
   (8th), Minkens (8th), Calvin/Smith (6th), and Bhatia/Dew (6th)
   - The Response sheet for the Consent form is HERE
   <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-eoHHmgkEKKRWulIGkci77oONgogOk1TLgJWJ0FJ2FE/edit?usp=sharing>


   - We would like a quote on 5 more carts. That would allow us to have one
   cart in each advisory space and one in the main office for tardy scholars.
   As a reminder: kids are allowed to check their devices out to take them
   home, but the default will be for them to be left at school in the carts.
   This makes carts shared across multiple advisory spaces very impractical.
   - We will need locks for the front and back of each cart, so 22-32
   total. I would like locks that are sturdier than the ones we currently have
   -- those can be pulled off without a lot of trouble.

Something else occurred to me: If we want kids to leave these devices at
school, we should have your work in each PMA consist of collecting their
old device and ensuring that the new device for each kid who has the
consent completed goes into the cart. Is there any need for the kids to
handle the devices before the next school day? Let me know what you think.

I received your email about the labels and covers -- I will order those
next week.

Thanks! Hope you are back to full health soon.

I'm just writing to share that three of my facilitators today either had to
cancel or use their personal device in order to facilitate their sessions
today. I just learned of these issues today, but what they shared with me
is below. Thanks!

Courtney Tarver @ Butler said she had issues all week and had to keep
restarting her computer. She mentioned that part of her trouble was because
they are currently remote. She had to cancel her sessions.

Janna @ Rauner reported the same issue - having to restart and still not
working. She was on campus and ended up using another device.

Nikki Cavitt @ Noble Street reported the same issue. Victor had given her
another device, but that one then wouldn't start. She had to cancel her

school about our Gym tech issues.

1) We talked about the mics.  Let us know - both what we can do to keep
them from fading in and out.   As I thought more about them, they are
simply stored on the stage.  Is this part of the issue that they are
trampled on?  Would more secure storage help ?

2) We spoke about computer safety when we use equipment. Thanks for walking
us through any bluetooth capabilities.  We can freeze the screen, close the
computer and still use the projector but I'm more focused on being able to
play sound and close my computer for safety reasons.

Let us know anything else we can do to help keep our tech going in the
gym.  :)

Our intercom has not been audible all year. We have sent multiple emails to
Johnson and Muchin Maintenance about this problem. One semester of the
school year has almost passed and there have been a multitude of Code
Oranges/Blues and a Red. When Lockhart gave the 8 minute long announcement,
our students missed out. I asked Johnson if we should move to an alternate
location in advance, but he thought the speaker was working. It wasn't.

At this point, I don't know what to do. We don't feel safe. Our students do
not feel safe. We have been reassured on multiple occasions not to worry
and that it is a top priority on the list of things to be fixed....and yet
it still does not work.

How can we expedite this process for the safety of our students?

offer this as a way around the connection issues, but wanted to know how I
should go about it.

Thanks!


   -

   SSM sign-in issues (Ongoing): Our iTeam at the Network level has been
   working to resolve the issue so many have reported with logging into and
   navigating SSM. Additionally, they are working with CPS’s IT Department and
   have ruled out it is a Noble network/internet issue. Here are some updates
   and reminders…
   -

      All staff should report issues and occurrences directly to their IT
      Lead’s  help desk
      -

      An interim workaround; for those that can connect with a MiFi; we
      connect them manually to a printer so they can  print documents.  We will
      make sure the IT Leads have this option ready to try out immediately.
      -

      This appears to be a complex issue related to the CPS application and
      we will need to rely heavily on CPS/ITS for a solution, which
can take time

Question #1:
What is the best way for me to get this information to you so that the new

Question #2
Is it possible to single add photos to student IDs in the system so that we
can update the information that is there with the new photo without having

6209308,Rauner,Juniors unable to access SAM in 206,"Hello! In Ms. Frazier and Ms. Birch's class this morning, they had several
students unable to log into SAM using this link below. I initially thought
it was a permissions issue, but when I was finally able to log in, I saw
that all juniors were logged into the SAM program. Can you help support
with log ins and figure out why students can't log in?

Emily said that a student was able to find and share a different link that
some students were able to access (but I wasn't sure what it was.)

6209227,Baker College Prep,12th grade PJ party Friday,"Hi Eric and Dustin!

Since I am out this week, I wanted to give some notes for the 12th grade
Friday PJ party on Friday that you both will be running for the seniors
while other students are testing. I'm sorry I won't be there to help!!

The general gist is that all the seniors are in the SC for the day and
there are holiday movies playing, kids get to chill, and we order them
pizza!

1) Brian, including you to check that the student center tech is working to
show movies. I know we have been having some issues with it the past few
weeks. Thank you!! Eric/Dustin, if Brian tells us it isn't working, you can
move to LH (but that isn't quite as fun, so hopefully SC works!)

2) I was going to order pizza for the seniors during the PJ party from
DeArcos. I would reach out to the ops team if you want help coordinating
this. Just make sure that students distance themselves how they would
during lunch to eat when the pizza comes.

3) The 12th graders voted for holiday movies a few weeks ago. One of you
will have to hook up your computer to play the movies. If you have to rent
any of them on Amazon, fill out the reimbursement form or get the school
card from the front office to purchase them.

Movie #1: Home Alone 1
Movie #2: Home Alone 2
Movie #3: The Grinch with Jim Carrey
Movie #4: Polar Express

Let me know if you guys need anything and thanks for making this a fun day
for our seniors!!

the listserv one at a time and it went through. I was able to send a couple
of other messages without trouble on the same days (Thursday and Friday).
Nobody else that I know of has had this problem, so I don't think there's a
problem with the listserv -- maybe something in my google account, or
something specific about my laptop or my network connection?

I'm not sure how to replicate the issue in a way that's helpful. Let me

6208828,Bulls,Projector and printer not working in 117,"Good Morning,

My projector has stopped working. It is really hot so I shut it off,
thinking this might have something to do with it. Ideally I would love to
be able to use 4th period, but can make it work if needed without.

My printer in 117 is also not working properly. It prints a page of just
black ink when anything is printed. I have tried printing multiple things
to see if the problem was with the document and I also turned it on and
off.

I am not sure what else to try?

Thank you for your help!

The students in room 100 use their computer 100% of the time. We are
finding it very challenging for them to complete tasks that require
internet. Currently, FAFSA has been a HUGE issue. We have 2 mifis that kids
often join in class (but they cannot print when on the mifi). Often the
mifis do not work and students have better luck joining a hotspot on their
phone. Pages either don't load or take a very long time to load, which is
slowing down the application process for them.

6207888,Butler College Prep,Browser Lockdown Modes,"Hi, Mr. Diaz

I have gotten questions regarding locking the browsers for when students
take assessments.  Currently, some students are going to other tabs while
taking assessments to look up answers.  I reached out to the Formative
folks to inquire about this, and this is the response I received:


   - Browser lockdown modes are available, but are designed to be used for
   infrequent, school-wide high stakes testing. They require a school IT
   administrator to turn it on and off, so it's not something the teachers can
   do at their leisure.

6207786,Hansberry,Fishing Email,"Hi Veleta,

This afternoon I clicked a link to something that I now think was a fishing email (it was, I thought, from my husband’s employer).  

I haven’t seen any suspicious activity yet but am wondering if there are any steps I need to take to avoid virus or data theft.

Thank you!

Some info on Joyia:

Please see notes/requests below:

Teachers- please update seating charts as needed and exempt student from
past assignments.

Mcswine- This student will be joining your advisory! I would like their
advisory buddy to be  Shaniya Hewitt for the day as they will have the same
schedule. Please introduce them in AMA and ask Shaniya to show them the
ropes throughout the day. I am putting a copy of their schedule in your
mailbox to give to them their first day in AMA.

*On student’s first day, they should report to main office for the start of
advisory to receive all materials. If student arrives first to advisory,
please send them to front office. Front office will direct student back to
advisory once they are done and student can be introduced to their buddy.

Operations- Can you give them a chromebook on their first day?

Brian- Can you give them PS/Email accounts and share that info with
Mcswine? Can you also add them to the appropriate grade-level email tree?
And lastly, can you create an authenticated Noble Zoom account for them?

My battery says it needs to be replaced on my laptop. My computer has

holding the charge for long. I had charged it all the way to 100% during

hours later.

6207167,Bulls,Internet   Common App Issues in 103,"Morning David,

I hope you are doing well! This may not be something you can do anything
about, but I figured it doesn't hurt to ask. Here goes.....

The wifi in 103 is not great. In particular our students have a lot of
trouble using commonapp.org - it often takes them to a page where they have
to re-sign in and they lose the updates they've made to their applications.

I too have had trouble connecting while using both NobleStaffCloud and NSCS
networks - Common App and Naviance are slow and my g-chat is inaccessible
at times.

Is there any way to get something like a ""boost"" to the wifi signal in our
classroom as our students use the internet every day in class and have
little the can work on when their connection is not strong?

I appreciate you helping us think through this -

Jill

around 30 minutes). It was working fine yesterday and according to him, it
hasn't been dropped or anything.

If there's nothing we can do, I'm sure we can give him one to borrow but I

6207084,Baker College Prep,New Student (9th)- M.Carter,"Hi everyone,

We have a new student joining us! Mohogany Carter is a 9th grader who
started some of her courses today by shadowing Linsey Lozoya. Mohogany was
an intercampus transfer, so the transfer procedures/timeline is a bit
different. Sorry for the short notice! She is our only intercampus transfer
at this time.

Please see notes/requests below:

Teachers- please update seating charts as needed and exempt student from
past assignments.

Tatroe- This student will be joining your advisory! I would like their
advisory buddy to be Linsey Lozoya for the day as they will have the same
schedule. Please introduce them in AMA and ask Linsey to show them the
ropes throughout the day. I am putting a copy of their schedule in your
mailbox to give to them their first day in AMA.

Operations- I am checking to see if this student still has their chromebook
from their previous noble school and will report back.

Brian- Can you give them PS/Email accounts and share that info with Tatroe?
Can you also add them to the appropriate grade-level email tree? And
lastly, can you create an authenticated Noble Zoom account for them?

Culture team- Can you assign him a locker/lock and share that info with
their new advisor?

The student’s schedule will be the following:

Several times a day students will be loading web pages that time out or

I have experienced the page timeout issue on my desktop as well.

6206906,NNST,Questions Regarding Spam Newsletters,"Hello -

I am an associate at the Alumni Career Office and I am looking for some
support on an issue I've experienced with third-party newsletters that are
sent to spam.

Once monthly, we send our email newsletter to around 18,000+ emails from
MailChimp. While preparing this month's newsletter, I realized that the
emails are now going to spam for gmail accounts which impacts over 70% of
our alumni contacts. We have never experienced this issue before. I have
tried a number of different changes to content, subject line, and audience,
but every change results in the same.

From looking into the issue, there are a few different reasons this could
be happening. When test emails come to my work email, the reason given for
going to spam says it's because it's like other emails that have been
flagged as spam in the past. When it goes to my personal email, however,
the reason given is the system couldn't verify that the email came from
alumnicareers@nobleschools.org. One reason could be our domain, which for
MailChimp is currently just nobleschools.org, not being verified. According
to mailchimp account settings, nobleschools.org is still verified, but I'd
like to get this checked if possible.

The other option was the IP address being blocked or flagged as having sent
spam before OR our alumnicareers@nobleschools.org email having experienced
the same issue. So I wanted to check and see if the IP address being used
or our email account has been flagged. Is this something that can be
checked?

The only change that was made between this month and last month was a new
audience that was imported into mailchimp using CSV, but even using other
audiences results in the newsletter going to spam.

I am happy to jump on a call as well if needed to explain the details too.

I attempted to print ID cards for our students last week and ran into two
major issues I'd like to problem solve with you:

1) The computer currently attached to the printer was exceedingly slow. I
don't know if this was a wifi/website issue or a device issue, but I could
select at most 25 cards at a time to print, and even that would take long
stretches of time to get sent to the printer.

2) The printer itself, which is brand new, jammed many many times in the
process. Each time it seemed like the printer tried to run two cards at
once. This was hard to rectify and also slowed down the process.

I spent all day Thursday trying to print and ultimately got through fewer
than 100 because of these issues. Can you check in today to see if we can
solve them and finish the printing this week?

My document camera (Elmo TT-02RX) has appeared to stop working in room 317.

When the device is turned on, it does not appear to be sending a signal. It
is clear that the device is sending SOMETHING, because it changes the
projector from the blue ""no input detected"" to black. I've tried adjusting
the settings. I've tried double checking that the wires are plugged in
correctly. I've tried unplugging it and letting power cycle.

I've also double checked to make sure that the projector cable itself is
also working. When plugging my computer directly into it, it DOES display.
I've been using that method for now as a work around.

Do you think you could check it out at some point? I don't know how old the
device is, but it has been here since at least before I started here.

I am writing to report that I need help logging into IMPACT.  I have been
having the same issue all year as well as last year.  I understand that
logging in has been an issue for many this year.  I also wanted to know if
I could get my own log in reestablished because my login has not worked
since before the pandemic.

6206417,NNST,Giving Financial Edge access to an external consultant,"IT team,

Would it be possible to give access to Financial Edge to an external

software, Sage Intacct? It would be useful to have this consultant be able
to look directly at our reports and data structure, straight within the
system.

This would necessitate access to our GlobalProtect VPN, too, I assume?
Would this person also need a @nobleschools.org account, or could this be
accomplished with her own e-mail address?

Please let me know. Thank you,

– Alejandro

campuses that have responded to PS tickets are being sent to my spam

on PS tickets or have been requesting for an update when one has already
been given.

I'm wondering if these two issues are related? Are you able to look into

6206186,Noble,3rd period AP Classroom connectivity issues,"Hi Everyone!

This is such a strange issue and I don't know what the cause or what
possible solutions are so I really need your help! :-)

Mr. Foulks has been working SOOOOO hard to get his students logged in to AP
Classroom so they can register for their AP exam. But he keeps running into
issues during 3rd period, specifically.

I pulled students this morning to bring them into the hallway -- hoping a
change of venue might resolve the issue -- but the same thing kept
happening: *students would continually get a spinning circle showing the AP
Classroom site was loading and loading and loading and . . . *

So, 1) I'm not sure why this is occurring and 2) I don't know how to fix
it. We need to have all students registered for their AP courses so I can
submit our order without incurring a $40 fee per test.

Any thoughts on our possible next steps?

Thank you!
Laura :-)

6206099,Pritzker,<Urgent> Locking Cabinet for Macbook & Cameras,"Hi Diana,

I just wanted to follow up on the ask I sent over from a few weeks ago
regarding a secure space to store supplies, and the spare laptop for using
the adobe creative cloud:

Hector brought me the Macbook after the all-staff, but had to take back the
spare HP laptop because we haven't received your approval. *Seeing as
students will not have the creative cloud on their chromebooks (the
chromebook isn't strong enough for the software), we need at least one
other device that students can use to do the following:*
-Put together the magazine (adobe indesign)-- E-board members will be using
this before/ after school hours
-Edit photos for the magazine and yearbook (adobe photoshop)--
photographers for the magazine & yearbook will be using this during the
school day AND before/ after school hours
- Create & edit podcasts (garage band or audacity)-- journalism students
will be using this during the school day and after school hours.

* Any time a students is using the device they will be supervised by me in
118.

To summarize, the program of over 200 students only has one device where
students can access these platforms.

That in mind, there is now over $4000 worth of supplies in 118 and there
isn't a secure space where these products can be held (I brought the
Macbook home this weekend so it wouldn't be left in the room
unprotected.) *Would
it be possible to get a new lock for my current file cabinet, or a cabinet
that locks so I may store these devices? *I do not want to  be held
responsible if something were to happen to these items while I'm not in the
building, nor would I want students to lose the opporyunity to learn these
skills.

*Please let me know how to proceed, or what I can do to help you make this
work. *I will happily fill out/ sign any paperwork needed so these items
are protected.

Feel free to give me a call or shoot me a text should you want to discuss
this further.

6205462,,Email trees for more efficient targeted emails <Action Requested>,"Hey ALT,

Sending this quick email so that we don't have to spend too much time on it
during our leadership team meeting tomorrow.  *I want us to move forward
with creating email trees for our teams and for the different subteams so
that not everything has to be sent to the all staff email.* For example- if
we need to send a message to the 7th grade teachers we should have an email
address that is for that group.

*Here's what I need each of you to do :*
1. Consider the teams or groups you manage or that communicate with most.
2. Identify the members of that group ( i.e. 6th grade advisors)
3. Send the name of the group and the names of its members to @gcms help
<gcms-help@catamounts.org> so that Jasmynn (copied here) can build an email
tree for that team.
4. Copy Brad on that send so that he can track these trees as part of our
staff directory .


If it's helpful, below are some ideas for trees that would make our email
systems more efficient. This is a non exhaustive list so feel free to
request the trees you want and need most. I have already submitted a
request for us to have an ALT tree as well.

Finally, there are some teams that already have trees that might not be
used with fidelity. When you submit your names and list, @Gist, Jasmynn
<jgist@nobleschools.org> will double check to make certain that there isn't
already a tree or that it is updated accordingly.

Potential Trees:
- each grade level advisory team
- one for all advisors
- each grade level team
- departments
- grade level leads
- advisory leads
- culture team
- mtss team


Let me know if you have questions,
Hemingway

6205411,,203Sound VCR,"Hi!
Tech-challenged one here in 203. Two very simple tasks that I don't know
how to do.

First, I'm trying to play a video from my computer to the projector and I
have no sound. I hear sound when it's just playing on my computer, but not
when projected.

Second, I'm using my VCR on Monday and Tuesday and need a refresher so I'm
not sending another stupid tech request.

Thank you for your patience. Told. You. So;(

Dear Melanie Chwee:
        I am writing to ask that you provide an evaluation of Jorge

an NROTC Scholarship and we would appreciate your evaluation of his/her
academic, social and leadership abilities.  Your comments are very
important to Jorge's application and we appreciate your assistance.  In
addition, it is essential that the transcript reflect rank in class along
with the most complete academic record to include grades received through
the junior year.  To expedite processing of Jorge's application and assist
in his/her selection to his/her first choice NROTC unit, please complete as
soon as possible. Please complete this evaluation on-line.  This is the
preferred method.  You may also request a paper copy to complete and return
to me by mail.  My contact information is at the bottom of this letter.
        Instructions for completing the evaluation are as follows - the
process should not take more than a few minutes to complete:
                1. Go to
https://netfocus.netc.navy.mil/NROTC/login2/nrotc.aspx   This web site is a
Department of Defense secure server site. You may get a browser pop-up
saying that the server certificate could not be verified. Do not be
alarmed. The US Government does not pay outside companies like Verisign to
'certify' our servers. Please accept the certificate (it's just like
accepting US Government issued money) and continue the evaluation. Click on
the Non_PKI Enabled Version and type in the following user name: and
password: or request a paper version of the evaluation by phone.
                2. Please fill in your name, title and phone number.
                3. Please indicate how long you have known this student.

                5. Please provide a short written evaluation of the
student.  It would be helpful for us if you comment on any or all of the
following areas: the student's current or past performance, academic
ability, character, integrity, leadership, and potential for success in a
demanding academic environment.  If you do not wish to make any written
statements the computer will prompt you to enter at least one word.  You
may state ""Decline to comment"" or ""Comments Attached"" as appropriate.
                6. After you have finished and reviewed your comments,
please click on the submit button.  Once you have submitted your comments,
you will not be able to access the evaluation again.
                7. Please authorize and release Jorge Bustamante's
secondary school transcript to the NROTC local processing center.


                        Thank you for your time.

forget their chromebook.

We will over message that kids need a charged chromebook but are
looking for a couple loaners for one off kids. We don't want them to be not

6205230,Butler College Prep,Issues with Cameras,"Sorry for the late notice, we have been having issues with our cameras.
They record in spurts with missing footage. Also in between the missing
footage we are having issues where the came shots become over-pixelated and
as an over-pixelated person walks across the screen it pixelates the rest
of the screen. It makes it nearly impossible to view live video and
especially review footage. When we had the cameras installed we requested
to have an in-house DVR for the storing and reviewing of the cameras and
footage to prevent issues like this. I'm not sure if it would be possible
to do that at this point or not, but at this point the way the cameras are
recording footage, it would be similar to not having any at all.

6205035,Johnson,E-hall pass for art   music,"Hey!

I'm wondering if it's possible to have a single, dedicated Chromebook in
both art (room 200) and music (room 110) classes for students to use e-hall
pass?

Since students don't generally use their own Chromebooks in those classes
due to other supplies (instruments, pianos, paint, etc.), a single
Chromebook in each space with an e-hall pass account dedicated/named ""Art
student"" or ""Music student"" (instead of individual student log-ins) would
be helpful for those spaces.

Is that possible?

6204812,Pritzker,Extra 2 Laptops for Journalism/ Locking Cabinet,"Hi Diana,

Happy Friday! I hope you are doing well.

Since we now have the Adobe creative cloud (THANK YOU FOR THAT) It would be
really useful if 118 had 2  HP laptops for students to use and practice
with new creative platforms. The cloud is large and difficult to navigate
on a chromebook.  As you know, non-phone tech doesn't always come easy for
our students, so I want to make sure we are able to put together the
magazine and get it to print as soon as possible.

Especially while we await the Macbook and students are finishing up their
articles, I want the kids to start familiarizing themselves with these
platforms so there are minimal bumps in the road when it comes time to
print.

*There isn't a need to purchase any laptops, as there already are  a few
extras in the tech office. Would it be ok if hector adds the creative cloud
to those laptops, and we use them in 118?*

Also, With all the tech in this room, none of the cabinets lock (I never
got any keys for either cabinet in my room). Would it be possible to have
new locks made for these cabinets, are there any locking ones somewhere
that I can have to store all the tech? My room is often used by the church
and while I doubt something would happen, I just want to be sure. Please
let me know how to proceed, and I will create a maintenance ticket based on
your guidance.

Thank you so much in advance, and for your continuous support.

Best,

could use? I'm not that bad, right? Nothing hard :) But wait!
The third one is related to the Adobe creative cloud subscription, or any

manipulate PDFs), but also having Illustrator and InDesign would be nice,

Thanks so much for all your help with all the student Chromebook issues.
Per our conversation this morning, to make sure we're tracking all the
students whose Chromebooks we send you, we will add them to this tracking
document:

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1reNPfU-bLCLK8kNxgRNFvFN6ZrbD2N5Yzb_MUAkxlVA/edit#slide=id.ge8107d4741_0_2

And we will not submit a help desk ticket for each Chromebook needing
support and instead track them here.

And this way, you can let us know if we need to replace any Chromebooks.

Thanks so much,
Allison

How are you? I'm continuing to have issues with my laptop where the CPU
usage goes to 100% and stays there, unless I close out every Google Chrome
window. The issue makes my computer essentially unusable, as it can't
connect to the internet during these times when it's lagging. I end up just
having to wait it out, which can take several minutes, unless I close out
all of my Chrome windows. See the attached screenshot for what I'm seeing
in the Task Manager.

This issue has bee leading to interruption in completing my duties for
several months now, but especially in the last couple months, the timing
has been poor, since it can happen at any time. Is there anything you can
do to correct this issue?

I know we're not supposed to email you things for our advisees-my
apologies, but I promised my advisee I would try to help her with this.
She has not been able to login to her chromebook all year.  I guess she
reached out to the office and was told to wait.  Apparently, the login info
she was given does not work.  She is a transfer student-her name is
Christina Smith.  I have her chromebook with me.  Any chance you would be
able to take a quick look at it sometime today to see what's going on?

interferes with her ability to log onto her Zoom for her virtual lesson. I
am not sure if her computer can be looked at perhaps, serviced, or switched
out for another.

In addition, just as a side note, many students are often frustrated with
the internet connection of the loaners from the office. THey experience
similar connectivity issues, and I just wanted to let you know.

6203236,Noble,Problems with Impact/SSM Login and use,"Hi Jorge and Tech Team Friends,

I was reaching out to follow up on a conversation that I started with Jorge
in person the other day regarding issues many of us at the OC are
experiencing with accessing SSM/Impact.

Corynn Ginnow and I have both been trying to login over the past few days,
and it seems that depending on the time of day, there are times where we
can't get in.

We also always have to start the process using the BIP-IP Edge Client and
then switch from Internet Explorer to Chrome to be able to access it at all
when it does work.

Also, Corynn Ginnow's laptop has a popup that keeps coming up regularly
from the BIP-IP Edge Client. It comes up a lot even once she closes it
out.  This same issue used to happen on my laptop as well, but now it
doesn't ever come up any more.

There are also times where one of us can log in but the other one of us
can't.  I'm also aware that there are a number of learning specialists who
are struggling to get into SSM/Impact as well.

Can you help us resolve these issues?

Thanks so much,
Josh

We have another student (Jai'Quan Simmons 11) with the same wifi issue as
yesterday. He has a chromebook that will lose wifi connection every few
seconds. I told him to visit the tech depot in the auditorium at the end of

6203138,Golder,Wifi Capability,"Hi Jorge,

Ms. McCabe came in this morning b/c she was running some practice AP exams
that are web-based and many of her students were not able to connect to the
internet or it kept dropping so they couldn't finish the questions.

She is concerned that this issue will continue throughout the year and is
wondering if there anything else that can be done to bolster the Wifi in
rm. 114.

My other question is: is it possible for the admin team to have 2 mifi's
that we can use in case of outages or when we are offsite?  We could then
lend these to instructors such as Ms. McCabe when the internet isn't
working well.

Let me know your thoughts.

6203132,Muchin,Printer Issues,"Hey Marco,

Just reaching out to let you know that the College Team printer in L09 has
been a headache for us thus fsar. The printer has been getting ""jammed""
every time we print something, only allowing us to print one page at a time
before it prompts us to ""unjam"" it. It has been a huge inconvenience.

We're hoping you can take a look at it and, if necessary, provide us with a
printer that allows us to be the most efficient with our time. We print a
lot of college documents as a team so having a printer that operates
effectively is vital to the success of our scholars. Any assistance you can
provide to resolve this issue would be greatly appreciated!

Best,

The College Team

*Thanks for taking my quick call earlier! Like I mentioned on the phone,
CPS will not allow Naviance accounts to be created using personal email
addresses. Instead, we'll have to request that James's email address be
temporarily re-opened so you can reset his PW, then he can log on using
that PW to upload his letters (or your team can do it for him on his
behalf). *

*Please send an email to U-help requesting that James's email be
temporarily re-opened for the purpose of updating his Naviance PW. Share
that you know that I've been in contact with Tony Briscoe for similar
situations at Bulls & Golder. In those cases, the email address was
temporarily re-opened, the dean updated the PW using ""forgot my PW"" and
then the account was closed again. If your tech person has questions, they
can email Briscoe directly.*



*This should take care of it! Let me know if you have any questions or want
me to loop in Briscoe on my end. I'm happy to do it!*
*Thanks,*
*Sarah*

6202727,Mansueto,mastery manager hardware request,"I'm sending this as both an official request and to make sure there isn't a
better option in the classroom. We want to use a scanning daily check quiz
setup for students to have written-on quizzes for both conceptual and
mathematical questions and we've realized that our best option is Mastery
Manager. This program is limited to only specific scanning devices (iOS and
Google) and so we can't use the HP laptops that you provided us.
It would be great if Marquise and I were able to get a pair of chromebooks
for them to be stationed in our room for daily scanning by students when
they finish their quizzes. One caveat is that we would either need access
to the google play account on them or for the ""SmartScan Go"" program to be
installed.

Hope you can help us. I know we're pretty backlogged with getting
chromebooks to kids so please let us know if this can't happen in the
near future.

Thanks,

From the administrator account, it says we have no licenses available.

6202538,Pritzker,Laptop issue,"Hi Hector,

I have a couple of issues.

1) the old laptop (038746) stopped working last night. It gives an error
message: ""UNMOUNTABLE BOOT VOLUME"".

This is okay, and I'd be happy to just move on, but I also have some
documents that I haven't saved elsewhere that I'd like to recover.

2. The new laptop (039098), won't accept my password.

I'll be in 206 at most hours of the day.

Thanks!

6202176,Butler College Prep,"Network Access Improvement Ticket, Room 279","Hi Bryan,

I was hoping perhaps we could look at finding a way to install something
near my room that might help the network connectivity (Noble Staff Cloud).
There have been numerous times where the connection has loaded slowly, or
has been lost altogether. I believe this may be due to the location of my
office in the far corner of Obama Hall.

A reliable network connection is critical for my role as Special Education
Director, as I will be conducting and facilitating the vast majority of our
IEP meetings virtually. Additionally, I will be using this space to
collaborate with my team of Learning Specialists, academic coaches, grade
level deans, among other admin. There are also various personal development
training videos and collaboration tools that require a strong network and
bandwidth from my office to participate in.

I understand this may take time as you may need to discuss options with
your team. Please keep me updated with how the issue can be resolved.

Thank you!

Greetings! I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out and ask
about my Adobe subscription. I pay monthly for Adobe XI Pro. Its about
fifteen dollars a month. I use it to help alumni fill out forms and
complete requests that I get for records and other things alumni-related.
The basics I use it for are filling in and signing forms, merging PDFs, and
resizing PDFs to be able to be uploaded to college portals. During the
pandemic, it was very helpful to help alumni complete verification
paperwork via Zoom. I'm wondering if you think I should continue paying the
monthly subscription or if I can get it installed permanently and not have
to pay to use it every month. Enjoy the rest of your day!

member, his email does not pop up as an option, but the student does. It

address, and I am concerned that we are sending information to the wrong

for suspensions & one for expulsions.)  I'd like to ensure that 1) these
emails are indeed fully functional and 2) that the right people are
identified as recipients of these emails.

Specifically, can you confirm the following email addresses are set:


   - SuspensionAppeal@nobleschools.org (recipient = Nick Jones)
   - ExpulsionAppeals@nobleschools.org (recipient = Drucila Flores)


Thanks so much for your support on this,

We have a chromebook cart in 103 but there are not any chargers in it.
Would you be able to put about 5 or 6 chargers in there? Our students need
chromebooks everyday for class and they don't always have them. At least
for the beginning of the year it is helpful for us to have loaners. The
cart that is in 102 has chargers in there but we don't know how to move
those so we thought we should ask you.

How are you? I hope you are having a great day.

On Friday I am Lexile testing in my class (computers are required for
this). This week many students have come to class without computers (either
they are damaged or do not have one yet). Additionally, in talking with a
teacher on my team today, he mentioned many computers students did not
connect to the testing site.

I really want to be proactive about this for Friday. Is there a chance I
could reserve 10-12 loaner computers for Friday, 9/17?  I want to ensure I
have a back-up solution so I do not have to send handfuls of students to
the office during class. What are your thoughts on this? I also CC'd Janna
here to see if this would be allowed.

Thank you so much!

Two questions.

The first is my computer keeps asking for a software update and I do not
have a password to allow this. What do I do?

Second of all, in my Powerschool my third period is not showing we're in
session everyday-I'm also throwing this at the Main Office as a query but
wondered if you knew how to reload their schedules so I can take daily
attendance?

Thanks,

I made a purchase on Teacherpayteachers, which is a safe website for

kept saying it could not download because ""Failed-Network Error."" I tried
to download it several times until it told me I didn't have permissions. I
have ordered so many things from that website, and have downloaded things
from multiple websites and never have had that problem. When I was finally
able to unzip the file, it created HTML Chrome files, but kept telling me
""Windows cannot complete the extraction because the destination file could
not be completed.""

In addition, anytime I try to stream something, it stalls and buffers
continuously. I've never had that happen before. Others listen to music on
their computers with no buffering.

Also, there is a delay when I try to get to websites. This is also
happening when I am here after hours and no one else is here.

We have another student computer situation but I'll let Lemon take the lead
on this since it's one of her advisory girls.

Yvonney Broadway-  50029825.  She called the IT number and left several
messages but hasn't received a call back.

I wanted to put a ticket it in because she's saying she needs a computer to
do some of her work for class this year.  She brought it to the school and
currently is in Lemon's room right now.

Let us know if you need anything else, thank you!

6200557,NNST,Google Drive issue,"Hello team,

Both Amber Johnson and I are having issues with google docs (specifically
forms). For starters, when we try to create a new Form in Drive we get this
error message. I can create new sheets, docs, slides just not Forms. When
we try to open some of our google forms we get the same error message
(while others work ok).

We had a teammate test a form
<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf1KPD-FWwSdtZKfKc02TH5xlldjlcIjiLCTWQQiwgpf73eVg/viewform>
that is giving us trouble and she was able to access the link and submit
it. Both Amber and I got the email notification that the form was submitted
(and we can see the response data in the linked sheet) but when we clicked
on the response link in the body of the email...same error message.
However, when the same teammate G chatted us the link to the form it opened
with no problem.

We are really struggling to identify the issue.

  I'm wondering if you could look into DaShawn Williams password situation.
He is unable to log into his Chromebook, and I'm wondering if it has
anything to do with the fact that he went to Gary Comer Middle and
something has not been changed on the back end---his password is
Catamount....
Best,
Joni

Wanted to follow-up on one request and add two more. Figured it'd be
easiest to combine into one email. I requested recently an email tree
creation for the Diverse Leaders Fellowship Cohort 4. The email created
from that ticket (DLFCohort4@nobleschools.org) bounces back with an error
message each time, however, and I have not been able to use it thus far.
This is formatted differently from last year's cohort email (
nn-dlf2020-fellows@nobleschools.org), maybe that's why? I'm unsure. *This
request is for the creation of a DLF Cohort 4 Fellows tree, a Cohort 4
Mentors tree, and a Cohort 4 combined tree. I also have a single person to
add to the DLF Community tree already in existence.* Thanks in advance!

6200299,Rowe-Clark,Student wifi/ labels,"Hey Rashad-

Several teachers have asked me what the student wifi is when they bring
their chromebooks on Fridays.

Secondly- Since students are bringing their chromebooks Fridays, many staff
expressed concerns with chromebooks not being labeled and it being
confusing for which one were students and which belong in the cart.

Can you create labels for each student by Advisory by Wednesday? and put in
each advisor mailbox.

WIth that, going forward, please put student name labels on all chromebooks
that are given out.

Thanks.

So I'm trying to do a quick export in Powerschool which should allow me to
export a report to Excel. However, when I click 'Submit', I get an error

reports in Powerschool on her computer, and the report went to Excel (or it
could've been Google Sheets, but either way it went to a spreadsheet and
not a PDF. Is this something you'd be able to help with? Is this due to

The Aunt confirmed after I asked to try to locate the computer that she was
unable to do so and hadn't had it since last school year.

The student is pretty anxious about the situation as she knows she needs it

I was reaching out to you all to inform you that Janet Rojas needs a
replacement for her old computer. Her old computer is not working, and she
brought her personal computer. However, my understanding is that students'
personal devices should not be connected to our school wifi. WIth that
being said, I was wondering what are Janet's alternatives since she will be
using her computers in her 10th grade classes this upcoming year. She is
currently using a rental that Ms. Tefera helped her get today from the main
office around 2:15ish.

If you all can informative about the next steps, please let me know so I
can inform Janet and mom.

Please see attached the screenshots of my computer screen when I try to run

think the issue is that I need admin approval to be able to download it to
my device. Is there an email and password that IT uses to allow things to
be downloaded to TNA devices? If there is a time you can meet with me to
enter it, please let me know.

Selene Roque's name is correct in PowerSchool but her email address  name

I am not sure who would be the one to fix this so I'm sorry for sending it
to both the office and the tech tree.

Let me know if there is something I can do to help!
Here's her email address:

6199488,Muchin,702 Projector Bulb,"Good Afternoon,

I am reaching out because Mr. Underwood inquired about a yellow tint on the
projector for 702. I briefly looked into the settings and did not see a way
to change the color tint, so I believe the bulb may be going out soon and
is the cause for the tint. Unfortunately, I am unsure about what the best
time to visit the room would be as I'm usually not in 702.

Best,

Hi Veleta,

 

Happy Wednesday!  

 

I need to have at least one cart of chromebooks updated with the new WISA AMS software.  I cannot complete the screeners (due by 10/1) or the ACCESS testing (done in semester 2) until the chromebooks receive the update.   

 

I have no preference on which cart of chromebooks gets the update, I just need to know which one so I can ensure that is the one I reserve for testing.   

 

Directions can be found here to update software on Windows <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vxGNMZ7K_LGg_vD8fzV9BjtoUShzQMy6/view?usp=sharing>  and Chromebooks <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Prz3johQPeVCAiOGOL-Z0vjkzuhHk7QtQA3kYQSFFRk/edit?usp=sharing> .

 

Thank you so much and please let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything I can do to help.

I would like to set up the conference room and main hall as a room open for

believe it can only be done on your end and if the organization is set up
with an account that has rooms.

Can you please look into this and let me know?  I basically want to be able
to have people reserve these rooms if they are available.

Hi there,


We have been thinking about changing the format for our mainline
(312-521-5287 line) calls for next year. We want to give callers options
when they call the mainline for NST to serve our stakeholders better. Not
immediate right now. I would like to have it all finalized *by August 1*,
if possible. People will leave a message or someone from any of those
team's direct lines will answer? These are just the preliminary stages. How
can I go about that? Please see the below examples:


Option 1-Enrollment-1-833-Be Noble

Option 2- Careers office

Option 3- Human Ressources Team

Option 4- Finance Team-Administration

Option 5-Technology-Vendors line to leave a message -someone will check it
.regularly

Option 6- Schools- Campuses- Alphabetical order for the caller to press
options? I don't foresee 18 different options, but I am sure we will
develop a great idea.

**Raise a concern or to speak to someone at NST Main Office press 0

I am copying Tony; I think this might include certain teams and
collaborations. It will change certain norms around to serve our students
and our community better.


Thank you,

I'm the new ELA hire for DRW. My computer is still acting very strange, so
I was wondering if you could check it out for me. The black screen appears
for about two minutes when I log in on the laptop before the home screen
pops up.
This also happens when my laptop falls asleep which is a problem I would
like to fix but cannot. The reason I can't is because the start tab and
search bar will not let me click on them. It's making it really difficult
for me to get things done because anytime that I'm not using the laptop, it
falls asleep right away and then the black screen situation happens all
over again.

Also, who would I contact to help me set up PowerSchool? I tried to log in
and it wouldn't let me. This will be useful for the first day of classes.

6198374,Johnson,Student Chromebook sign out when idle,"Hi Ms. Brewer.  Since we moved to a 1:1 chromebook system, I was thinking
it may be good to consider changing the auto logout settings for student
chromebooks.  Since students are using the same chromebook all day, it may
be good to allow them to stay signed in even when closing the lid between
classes.  Last spring, I saw a lot of students walking around with their
chromebooks open to avoid being logged out.

Thoughts on this?  I would suggest that the chromebook sleep and lock when
the screen is closed but not log them out.

Hi Christine,

We’re reaching out because you use YouTube at school with a Google Workspace

In this type of account, you use your school email address, and your school

manages
your access to Google products like YouTube.

?

*Starting in the coming weeks:* Because your school admin has marked you as
under 18 years old, *you’ll see a new, limited version of YouTube designed
for schools when you use your school account*. This means you won’t be able
to do things like comment, live chat, or receive most notifications
<https://notifications.google.com/g/p/AD-FnEwnrywnQe5xmW_U2V48fo5MTGSeyAhZ-ZJofUBEyNnpkzLqe4M9sLckHNz99nfIt8JeHx1ARf78W5CYGia2c6RxDaJCeYSwmG-hHNLylBKRzowWggg9aGpAftUrar9dRPvCjA>.
You also won’t be able to create YouTube videos and may not be able to
watch certain videos.

?

This new experience is automatically given to students marked as under 18.
But this only impacts your YouTube experience on your school account and *does
not impact the YouTube experience on your personal account*.

?

If you have uploaded videos to your school YouTube account, your channel
will be hidden. You can download and save your videos using Google Takeout
<https://notifications.google.com/g/p/AD-FnEyCcZd1vWsjqxVfwQicD7vCLEZdBiFjfH6oWQ1HXCc72fe_TeDjWXtqJJoskfGUIxtciEF5V2wwS6iwFBRr4rv2p7bk75k0LJQvDJOwg5M>
(when
turned on by your admin).

?

In the coming months we will also be launching a tool that will allow you
to directly move videos from your school account channel to a personal
account. We will reach out with more details when the tool opens.

?

For more info on your school YouTube account, please visit our Help Center

Question for you - one of our teacher's computer monitors was broken last
night after school hours; do you possibly have an extra HDMI-compatible

I recorded a Zoom interview to use in class next week.  I'm able to play it
in my iTunes account but when I shared it with other teachers they were not
able to play it.  Can you take a look and perhaps save a version that is
playable on another platform?  You can find the video in this folder
<https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1t6oQR4KaLMcPZtcSMc-c5m9qN7AtXAz9>,
it's OK to save a new version in the same folder.  I also attached it in
case the folder doesn't allow you access.

Take care

6197296,Rauner,Issue with RCP Student Logins,"Hey ALl,

I hope that you are enjoying your weekend. I submitted a ticket the other
day, but I think I found that the issue is different than what I previous
thought. I've broken down the issues that I have founds.

*Issues with RCP Student Logins*

Issue #1 - On the Class 2025 tab here
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MxG04g5l450dGmEldhDWhMm_fnw-N5Ztgm917M8awrY/edit#gid=917975828>,
we have a bunch of students without emails or password.
Issue #2 - On the Class 2025 tab here
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MxG04g5l450dGmEldhDWhMm_fnw-N5Ztgm917M8awrY/edit#gid=1610681004>,
there is no user name listed. Instead, we have something called CB Asset#.
What is that?
Issue #3 - Transfer students are not listed here
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MxG04g5l450dGmEldhDWhMm_fnw-N5Ztgm917M8awrY/edit#gid=970352974>
.
Issue #4 - Advisor fields are wrong for many students on all tabs here
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MxG04g5l450dGmEldhDWhMm_fnw-N5Ztgm917M8awrY/edit#gid=970352974>(it
looks like they never get cleaned up.

*Issues with Quick Export Fields (see attached file)*
Issue #1 - Attached spreadsheet has a student who doesn't have a web ID
Issue #2 - Attached spreadsheet shows students who have nothing come up for
the quick export field of ""Student_Web_Password""
Issue #3 - This may not be an issue, but a handful of students who are
intercampus transfers have passwords related to their last campus when I
pull Student_Web_Password. They are in a separate tab. Can you please
confirm if these are correct?


General Question: If a student's powerschool and email password the same?

dropping and then at some point later comes back. It’s staying connected to

As we discussed earlier today, I just wanted to remind you about the
extension cord for the phone.
I also wanted to touch base on the printer situation. If there does happen
to be an extra color printer around that isn't being used, that would be
really helpful to be in my class.
Please let me know if this is possible, Thank you!

I am having trouble with Google slides giving me the following error
message.  I have tried: 1. Going home to work (thought there might be
network issues at Speer). 2. Making a new copy and working there, 3.
Restarting my computer.
These things have worked to save a draft, which I can then work on for a
little longer, but then, I'll get this message again.

Is everyone having Google Drive troubles?

We hope you had a great summer and found time to relax and rejuvinate!

So, Tom and I are new to Room 005 so we're figuring out our tech needs. So
far, it looks like we just need two things:
1) a way to connect our computer and the ELMO to the projector using an
HDMI port
2) a way to connect our computer to the sound system.

the STLS thing back with the up front staff to lockup because I didn't want
to be responsible for them yet.  So the STLS items have arrived but I don't

6194504,Bulls,Updating Email Trees for SY21-22,"Hi David -

I have the majority of our email trees updated for SY21-22.

   1. On the first tab ""08.19.21 Notes
   <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1goOsT49_SVMHaCbhuRDc4EYxqBdZFDidBc-rnNU54Sw/edit#gid=1266755562>""
   you'll see some directions on trees we are creating for this year and some
   trees that we'd like to close or have redirected.
   2. On the second tab ""08.19.21
   <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1goOsT49_SVMHaCbhuRDc4EYxqBdZFDidBc-rnNU54Sw/edit#gid=2136853161>""
   you'll see our staff list and who belongs on what trees. Could you check
   off the box in row one when you're done updating each tree? This will just
   help me stay on top of when they are ready as I know this takes a bit of
   time.

Thanks, David!

Hope all is well. I was just contacted by Latoya Money, the mother of
Phoenix Kelly. She told me that Phoenix's chromebook broke and that she
reached out to the Noble IT hotline, which told her that they would send a
message to GCCP to get Phoenix's chromebook replaced. I would like to
follow up on that and see if you were contacted by Noble IT about this.

6194365,,SRI (Scholastic Reading Inventory),"Hey team,

So in the transition from Sean to Friendella, I think we might have missed
the ordering of the Lexile testing online software for this school year.
I've cc'ed Mann and Hernandez on this email because we are signed up for a
literacy pilot and I want to make sure we aren't double ordering this
software.

We are planning on having all our students this year take a lexile test
sometime this year, but most urgently we have our 9th grade students slated
to take the test on September 7th in the afternoon. Gives us three weeks to
get it purchased and up and running, and if I remember correctly this is a
very doable deadline.

Mann and OB, can you double check to make sure the websites below are the
ones that we used last year with Forester and that we haven't already
purchased? I believe to be the website we used last year:
https://www.hmhco.com/programs/reading-inventory#overview

Friendella, once Mann and OB gives us the green light that this is the
correct program, can you fill out this contact form about a quote and they
will follow up <https://learning.hmhco.com/contact-us-reading-inventory> and
get us in the processes of purchasing and getting the information up and
running. We should be able to purchase this, upload a roster of our
freshmen students, and then generate usernames and passwords that we can
mail to kids. Once you get in contact with someone and get it purchased, I
can help you with pulling a roster of 9th grade students.

We need to have this thing up and running by September 7th, so please reply
all to keep everyone up to date.

-Steve


P.S. This is a copy of the form from the AP at Rauner and I know this was
the same type of software we used last year for reference.

In getting ready with returning back to school- Erin and I will be sharing

with the interns for RM 116 which will also be our Calm Room for students.
Is it possible to set up and move the printer to RM 116 between now and

I'll be at the school again this week to work on clearing some space for
the printer in RM 116 so it's an easy set-up.

Let us know if you need anything else regarding set-up.

similar to SY 19-20, we will need student IDs to have a colored dot printed
on them. This will indicate which lunch space they need to go to.  This
only applies to 9th and 10th graders. We can provide a list in the upcoming

6194079,Pritzker,Pritzker Google Log-In Question,"Hi -

Does the school’s handbook / IT policy restrict us in any way from logging into services related to our work with our G-Suite login.

Specific actual example- a colleague sent me a dropbox link with curriculum content. But to access that, Dropbox requested access to download all of my contact information from my Pritzker g-suite account. I know that at my schools in New York, that included student contact info, and that would be a problem. I don’t know what the situation is here.

(1) Can I log-in to whatever I want with my G-suite login?

(2) if the answer to question (1) is no, what are the restrictions?

Would it be possible to get edit access to a Google calendar invite created
by someone else, to which I don't have permission to change details?

Some details:
-- Brooke Semel, who is now on medical leave, created a Google Calendar
invite for a training taking place Friday, August 20th *(""Budgets and
Forecasting for Noble Leaders""; Friday, August 20?1:00 – 2:30pm)*
-- Several guests have already confirmed, so I don't want to create a new
invite, and keep using the same one Brooke created
-- The details I'd like to add are including a link to a Zoom video
conference, and another link to the training slides

Can you help? Below is a screenshot of the invite. Thank you!

6193937,Comer,iPhone stolen,"Hello!
I went to the car dealership for service on Monday, and I am pretty sure my
iPhone was stolen from my car. I used the 'Find Your iPhone' app and it was
located at the dealership, but when I called to ask about it, everyone said
nobody has turned it in. I didn't have it with me when I waited for service
on my car, which is why I believe that it was in my car and was then stolen
(i.e. ""found"" and not turned in). The app is still tracing it there. What
are next steps?

6193933,DRW College Prep,Padlet Subscription,"Hey Kye-Anne & Joshua,

I am looking to purchase a subscription to Padlet. At first, this was
something that would come out of the Student & Culture support budget (with
Justin, myself, and Quinton being users). However, after hearing a few folx
in our L-Team meeting express interest in using Padlet this year, I am
wondering if we can purchase a school wide subscription that would not hit
the student culture and support budget, but that would allow all of
our teachers access to creating pro accounts with unlimited Padlets.

Here <https://padlet.com/premium/backpack>is where you can see an overview
of Padlet. Here <https://padlet.com/premium/backpack/pricing> is where you
can find the information about pricing. Here
<https://padlet.com/premium/backpack/quotation> is where you can request a
quote.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns!

First, I heard you're leaving Noble. Congratulations! We will seriously

Estrella Arauz had a hard time joining a zoom meeting with me today, and I
realized it was probably because she needs to set up her TNA zoom account.
:) Is this something you'll be supporting new hires with during onboarding?

We have a few changes to the phones.

We would like the phones to stay on the cellphones for the summer
Monday-Friday July 7th-August 20th 8:00 am-2:00 pm.

*August 23rd -27th*  - on the cellphones from 8:00am - 4:00pm.

*August 23, 2021* - Phones off for all school PDs.

*August 25, 2021* - Phones off for Network PDs at 12:00pm-4:00pm

*August 30, 2021* - we would like the school's phones to be turned back on

Herika also wants to keep google voice and not discount the services.

I'd like to create an email specifically for recruitment/enrollment
questions and concerns. In past times, those emails came directly to/from
me, which they still would, but I'd like them filtered from my other emails
since I serve Noble with so many different aspects of my title. If you have
a better way of doing this, that can be simpler than having 2 email
addresses, please let me know!

6193588,Mansueto,computer auto turns on...programming?,"Morning friend,
I've been working with the microsoft support for my surface book for a bit,
but there is an interesting glitch that has been occuring with this
computer that didn't happen on the previous one (which I owned
independently). The computer automatically restarts every time I turn it
off. By simply choosing the power --> shut down option it automatically
turns back on as if I chose the restart option. If I push and hold the
power button for the hard shut down option it will stay off for an
undetermined amount of time but then turn back on randomly. This isn't a
terrible problem other than the fact that it completely depletes its
battery in my backpack over the course of several hours and when I pull it
out to use it, expecting it to be fully charged, it is dead. I have been
interacting with Microsoft support to see if they could see any simple
settings that could have been toggled or if when we first got it or if
there was a scheduled restart or anything of the sort but they haven't
found anything. They walked me through the process of fully updating all
the settings and making sure the drivers are all up to date (not just for
microsoft stuff, but also for the uniquely surface programming) and it is
still doing it.
My reason for emailing you this morning is to ask if there is any reason to
think that the program for updating the security software or something else
might be doing this. I haven't logged on with it in over a month and there
is an alert that has been reminding me about (proxy settings?) need to be
updated. Could this cause the pc to restart on its own? Do you have any
idea why this should be happening?

*Nate *-- can you/Anna take care of the following for the room by Tuesday
noon? It's on your list of to-dos, so should not be new.


   - *Room should be completely ‘clean’ of teacher items (no papers,
   posters, borders, loose items).  *
   - *What remains in room = teacher desk, chair, 25 student desks/chairs,
   bookshelf(s) emptied, file cabinet emptied. *
   - *Remove extra desk/chairs.  Stage on 3rd floor*


*Not on the list: *

   - *The classroom is going to need an extra teacher desk + chair. Can you
   chat with Amy to see which desk you should pull from 311 for Maria
   Figueroa?*
   - *Room 209 and from 308 also need an extra teacher desk + chair. Can
   you chat with Amy to see which desk you should pull from 311 for
   Pallardy/Kent (209) and Carroll (308). *
   - *209 will need students desks and chairs, but I'll let you know where
   to pull from for those.*


*Jose *-- the new laptops need to be moved to another room. Ah...but I
don't know where. Maybe 303 for now? Also, what do you need from me in
terms of getting those ready? Should I send Steph and another person to
help you remove them from boxes? I can ask Alex to send them to you asap.
Should we put them in boxes/containers for now?


Appreciate you both!

6193312,NNST,Zoom Passcode Issue,"Good afternoon!

Our Alumni Career Office uses Calendly so alumni can schedule meetings with
us.  When they do so, it is set to automatically schedule these meetings
via Zoom.  Starting yesterday, we have had issues with alumni accessing the
meetings because a passcode is now required.  However, our invites don't
note what the passcode is.

I went into my Zoom settings and noticed that they have been adjusted so
that passcodes are required, however the option to turn this off is locked
by the admin.

Is it possible to turn that setting off so a passcode isn't needed?  If
not, do you know of other solutions we can take so that we can still
leverage Calendly for alumni to automatically schedule Zoom meetings with
our team?

6193237,,Replacement computer request,"Hi iTeam!

I was hoping to hold off for another year, but I think I probably need to
get a new computer. As you can see from the picture the case of my laptop
has been warping (maybe because I've rarely closed it for the last 1.5
years?) and now there's a permanent open gap under the touchpad.

I was going to work through that, but over the last couple of days there
has been intermittent steady noise coming from the hard drive that makes me
worry that there's a hardware issue pending there. I'm thinking that means
it's time to go for a replacement.

Unfortunately, I don't think I can get by with our standard PC
configuration because of the programming work that I do on my laptop and
would like a replacement to have the following specs:
-i7 or equivalent
-16GB RAM or better
-14"" screen
-3 lb weight or close to it

(This HP zbook that I got in late 2018 has roughly those specs and
generally meets my needs, even with the older i7.)

All of my main files are in a Dropbox folder, so I can manage the transfer
of files to a new computer if you all get it and do the initial setup.

Thanks!

I hope you’re enjoying your summer!

An advisee of mine, Elisset Jacinto (class of ‘24) received a new laptop and provided me with the old chrome book and charger to return to you. I placed them on my desk with a post-it.

The next time you’re in the building, feel free to swing by my room and grab the device.

be able to reactivate her account (and Google Classroom account) so we can
assess when the project was turned in? The grade in this class is impacting
whether she can stay in the College of Engineering at UIUC or not, and the
deadline is tomorrow?

this possible?

L17
723

Josh, I think. You ended up making the previous meeting rooms (or maybe you sent it to Alberto — I can’t remember). The important thing is I need them to also appear under “My calendars” so that I can manage them and share access as needed.  

Thing #2 - Is there a way to see what other room reservation calendars exist for Muchin? I just want to make sure there are no redundant calendars that could cause confusion.  

Thing #3 - Can you delete all of the chromebook cart reservation calendars. We will only need one of the calendars to reserve the one chromebook cart we will have on campus.  

Thanks for your assistance and let me know if you have any questions!!!

6192894,Rowe-Clark,Google Voice question,"Hey Rashad-

I was thinking about google voice and our desk phones/ extensions. Is there
a program that we can use to connect with the school phone for forwarding?
In which we could get rid of the desk phones and everyone just use
their google voice number. I think this would help with staff being more
reachable for parents since they would be able to text them vs just leaving
them a voicemail (that not many people listen to or respond back).

I think implementing a new system will be more efficient going forward.

We can talk more through it, but wanted to throw it out there so you could
start looking into it.

My name is Norma Gutierrez and I am in a new role at NST (Manager of
Student Experience). I am reaching out with a few tech questions:

   - I am using a new computer (a mac) and am downloading apps/programs.
   When I was instructed to enter my password I noticed that my name is
   spelled incorrectly. My name on the computer shows up at ""Norma Gutirrez""
   instead of ""Norma Gutierrez"" (it's missing the e).
   - My manager, Janine Franklin, asked me to log into the Noble Self
   Service Portal but I am unable to do so because I don't know my username or
   password.
   - In my new role I will be supporting DoSs across the network - I need
   my new email address added to the DoS tree and also, I will now be the
   manager of that email tree.

Please let me know if you have any questions and thanks for your help!

6192498,NNST,Technical Difficulties with my computer,"Hello,

Since the morning, my computer has been acting really weird. Whenever I try
to increase the volume, it goes up by itself to 100. If I want to schedule
a google calendar invite and view others' calendars, their name appears but
disappears right away. If I try to browse through my google drive- the
documents move by themselves.

I restarted my computer a few times already and fixed the volume problem.
Since I restarted it, I keep getting text messages from *837402 *saying the
following: Use #code to verify isalgado@nobleschools.org using Chrome on
Windows 10.

Can you please let me know how I can fix the text issue and my Gmail?
