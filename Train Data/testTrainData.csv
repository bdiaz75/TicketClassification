6210398,Gary Comer Middle School,Chromebook distribution,"Jasmynn:

Thanks for meeting with me -- I'm glad to hear you are feeling better.

Here's what we have:


   - The communication I sent to staff is HERE
   <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wKXlVqxOWfdfbGaEFpH_-cKLX6eeyIgZgHPFaIMMsgA/edit?usp=sharing>
   - The communication I sent to parents is HERE
   <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ezvry4Ziv008Hxg2tDlvb3oAzV8X8e4mgmOIeTV6jSg/edit?usp=sharing>
   - The revised distribution calendar (still tentative) is HERE
   <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IaU5RlMgY65C9LUhXFRqfcQ19HMah0K_FS8ROGB6N3I/edit?usp=sharing>.
   I went 8th grade, then 6th, then 7th, but I pushed the rooms that don't
   currently have carts to the back end of the list. That would be Dunlap
   (8th), Minkens (8th), Calvin/Smith (6th), and Bhatia/Dew (6th)
   - The Response sheet for the Consent form is HERE
   <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-eoHHmgkEKKRWulIGkci77oONgogOk1TLgJWJ0FJ2FE/edit?usp=sharing>


   - We would like a quote on 5 more carts. That would allow us to have one
   cart in each advisory space and one in the main office for tardy scholars.
   As a reminder: kids are allowed to check their devices out to take them
   home, but the default will be for them to be left at school in the carts.
   This makes carts shared across multiple advisory spaces very impractical.
   - We will need locks for the front and back of each cart, so 22-32
   total. I would like locks that are sturdier than the ones we currently have
   -- those can be pulled off without a lot of trouble.

Something else occurred to me: If we want kids to leave these devices at
school, we should have your work in each PMA consist of collecting their
old device and ensuring that the new device for each kid who has the
consent completed goes into the cart. Is there any need for the kids to
handle the devices before the next school day? Let me know what you think.

I received your email about the labels and covers -- I will order those
next week.

Thanks! Hope you are back to full health soon.

I'm just writing to share that three of my facilitators today either had to
cancel or use their personal device in order to facilitate their sessions
today. I just learned of these issues today, but what they shared with me
is below. Thanks!

Courtney Tarver @ Butler said she had issues all week and had to keep
restarting her computer. She mentioned that part of her trouble was because
they are currently remote. She had to cancel her sessions.

Janna @ Rauner reported the same issue - having to restart and still not
working. She was on campus and ended up using another device.

Nikki Cavitt @ Noble Street reported the same issue. Victor had given her
another device, but that one then wouldn't start. She had to cancel her

school about our Gym tech issues.

1) We talked about the mics.  Let us know - both what we can do to keep
them from fading in and out.   As I thought more about them, they are
simply stored on the stage.  Is this part of the issue that they are
trampled on?  Would more secure storage help ?

2) We spoke about computer safety when we use equipment. Thanks for walking
us through any bluetooth capabilities.  We can freeze the screen, close the
computer and still use the projector but I'm more focused on being able to
play sound and close my computer for safety reasons.

Let us know anything else we can do to help keep our tech going in the
gym.  :)

Our intercom has not been audible all year. We have sent multiple emails to
Johnson and Muchin Maintenance about this problem. One semester of the
school year has almost passed and there have been a multitude of Code
Oranges/Blues and a Red. When Lockhart gave the 8 minute long announcement,
our students missed out. I asked Johnson if we should move to an alternate
location in advance, but he thought the speaker was working. It wasn't.

At this point, I don't know what to do. We don't feel safe. Our students do
not feel safe. We have been reassured on multiple occasions not to worry
and that it is a top priority on the list of things to be fixed....and yet
it still does not work.

How can we expedite this process for the safety of our students?

offer this as a way around the connection issues, but wanted to know how I
should go about it.

Thanks!


   -

   SSM sign-in issues (Ongoing): Our iTeam at the Network level has been
   working to resolve the issue so many have reported with logging into and
   navigating SSM. Additionally, they are working with CPS’s IT Department and
   have ruled out it is a Noble network/internet issue. Here are some updates
   and reminders…
   -

      All staff should report issues and occurrences directly to their IT
      Lead’s  help desk
      -

      An interim workaround; for those that can connect with a MiFi; we
      connect them manually to a printer so they can  print documents.  We will
      make sure the IT Leads have this option ready to try out immediately.
      -

      This appears to be a complex issue related to the CPS application and
      we will need to rely heavily on CPS/ITS for a solution, which
can take time

Question #1:
What is the best way for me to get this information to you so that the new

Question #2
Is it possible to single add photos to student IDs in the system so that we
can update the information that is there with the new photo without having

6209308,Rauner,Juniors unable to access SAM in 206,"Hello! In Ms. Frazier and Ms. Birch's class this morning, they had several
students unable to log into SAM using this link below. I initially thought
it was a permissions issue, but when I was finally able to log in, I saw
that all juniors were logged into the SAM program. Can you help support
with log ins and figure out why students can't log in?

Emily said that a student was able to find and share a different link that
some students were able to access (but I wasn't sure what it was.)

6209227,Baker College Prep,12th grade PJ party Friday,"Hi Eric and Dustin!

Since I am out this week, I wanted to give some notes for the 12th grade
Friday PJ party on Friday that you both will be running for the seniors
while other students are testing. I'm sorry I won't be there to help!!

The general gist is that all the seniors are in the SC for the day and
there are holiday movies playing, kids get to chill, and we order them
pizza!

1) Brian, including you to check that the student center tech is working to
show movies. I know we have been having some issues with it the past few
weeks. Thank you!! Eric/Dustin, if Brian tells us it isn't working, you can
move to LH (but that isn't quite as fun, so hopefully SC works!)

2) I was going to order pizza for the seniors during the PJ party from
DeArcos. I would reach out to the ops team if you want help coordinating
this. Just make sure that students distance themselves how they would
during lunch to eat when the pizza comes.

3) The 12th graders voted for holiday movies a few weeks ago. One of you
will have to hook up your computer to play the movies. If you have to rent
any of them on Amazon, fill out the reimbursement form or get the school
card from the front office to purchase them.

Movie #1: Home Alone 1
Movie #2: Home Alone 2
Movie #3: The Grinch with Jim Carrey
Movie #4: Polar Express

Let me know if you guys need anything and thanks for making this a fun day
for our seniors!!

the listserv one at a time and it went through. I was able to send a couple
of other messages without trouble on the same days (Thursday and Friday).
Nobody else that I know of has had this problem, so I don't think there's a
problem with the listserv -- maybe something in my google account, or
something specific about my laptop or my network connection?

I'm not sure how to replicate the issue in a way that's helpful. Let me

6208828,Bulls,Projector and printer not working in 117,"Good Morning,

My projector has stopped working. It is really hot so I shut it off,
thinking this might have something to do with it. Ideally I would love to
be able to use 4th period, but can make it work if needed without.

My printer in 117 is also not working properly. It prints a page of just
black ink when anything is printed. I have tried printing multiple things
to see if the problem was with the document and I also turned it on and
off.

I am not sure what else to try?

Thank you for your help!

The students in room 100 use their computer 100% of the time. We are
finding it very challenging for them to complete tasks that require
internet. Currently, FAFSA has been a HUGE issue. We have 2 mifis that kids
often join in class (but they cannot print when on the mifi). Often the
mifis do not work and students have better luck joining a hotspot on their
phone. Pages either don't load or take a very long time to load, which is
slowing down the application process for them.

6207888,Butler College Prep,Browser Lockdown Modes,"Hi, Mr. Diaz

I have gotten questions regarding locking the browsers for when students
take assessments.  Currently, some students are going to other tabs while
taking assessments to look up answers.  I reached out to the Formative
folks to inquire about this, and this is the response I received:


   - Browser lockdown modes are available, but are designed to be used for
   infrequent, school-wide high stakes testing. They require a school IT
   administrator to turn it on and off, so it's not something the teachers can
   do at their leisure.


Is there a way you can do this?",1

6207786,Hansberry,Fishing Email,"Hi Veleta,

This afternoon I clicked a link to something that I now think was a fishing email (it was, I thought, from my husband’s employer).  

I haven’t seen any suspicious activity yet but am wondering if there are any steps I need to take to avoid virus or data theft.

Thank you!

Some info on Joyia:

Please see notes/requests below:

Teachers- please update seating charts as needed and exempt student from
past assignments.

Mcswine- This student will be joining your advisory! I would like their
advisory buddy to be  Shaniya Hewitt for the day as they will have the same
schedule. Please introduce them in AMA and ask Shaniya to show them the
ropes throughout the day. I am putting a copy of their schedule in your
mailbox to give to them their first day in AMA.

*On student’s first day, they should report to main office for the start of
advisory to receive all materials. If student arrives first to advisory,
please send them to front office. Front office will direct student back to
advisory once they are done and student can be introduced to their buddy.

Operations- Can you give them a chromebook on their first day?

Brian- Can you give them PS/Email accounts and share that info with
Mcswine? Can you also add them to the appropriate grade-level email tree?
And lastly, can you create an authenticated Noble Zoom account for them?

please send them to front office. Front office will direct student back to
advisory once they are done.

Operations- Can you give them a chromebook on their first day?

Brian- Can you give them PS/Email accounts and share that info with
Ms.Mcswine? Can you also add them to the appropriate grade-level email
tree? And lastly, can you create an authenticated Noble Zoom account for
them?
