I am filing a ticket for Joseph Kabre. The screen on his Chromebook is

6209406,Noble,Solved the Elmo issue,"Hi Victor,

I went ahead and switched out the Elmo for Ms. Pallardy in 208. She's set.

If you can, please pick up the other Elmo in Room 207 and store it in your
office upstairs.

Currently, room 202 does not have an Elmo (that's where I got it from), but
if you can check in with Mr. Miranda in 202 to see how soon he'd like a new
one, that would be super helpful for him.


Appreciate you,
Nikki

I hope the week is off to a good start!  We will be doing Q2 interim
testing starting Thursday for our Audio testers.

I am writing because I anticipating needing ~20 or so chromebooks or
computers for students to test on.

They have all been told to bring their personal chromebooks, but given how
last time went, we will need some spares. Last time they received the same
messaging and we needed about 20 computers.

I was told there were either laptops or chromebooks set aside for testing.
If this is the case, please let me know where to locate them.

If this is not the case, we will need to use the loaner comps from the
office and communicate that there aren't any loaners on Thursday.

6209227,Baker College Prep,12th grade PJ party Friday,"Hi Eric and Dustin!

Since I am out this week, I wanted to give some notes for the 12th grade
Friday PJ party on Friday that you both will be running for the seniors
while other students are testing. I'm sorry I won't be there to help!!

The general gist is that all the seniors are in the SC for the day and
there are holiday movies playing, kids get to chill, and we order them
pizza!

1) Brian, including you to check that the student center tech is working to
show movies. I know we have been having some issues with it the past few
weeks. Thank you!! Eric/Dustin, if Brian tells us it isn't working, you can
move to LH (but that isn't quite as fun, so hopefully SC works!)

2) I was going to order pizza for the seniors during the PJ party from
DeArcos. I would reach out to the ops team if you want help coordinating
this. Just make sure that students distance themselves how they would
during lunch to eat when the pizza comes.

3) The 12th graders voted for holiday movies a few weeks ago. One of you
will have to hook up your computer to play the movies. If you have to rent
any of them on Amazon, fill out the reimbursement form or get the school
card from the front office to purchase them.

Movie #1: Home Alone 1
Movie #2: Home Alone 2
Movie #3: The Grinch with Jim Carrey
Movie #4: Polar Express

Let me know if you guys need anything and thanks for making this a fun day
for our seniors!!

it sometimes makes like a loud ""beep"" or ""eek"" noise - it sounds like a
wire isn't connected properly or something? It makes the sound at random
times too, not necessarily at the beginning of a video or anything like
that.

I've made sure that the HDMI cable is fully in my computer (and it is as
far as I can tell), but not sure what else to try!

I'll be in L08 for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th period (teaching) or PMA (teaching),
or after 3:42-4:00pm today!

Thank you!

6201155,Rauner,Loaner Computer Reservation Question,"Hi Jose,

How are you? I hope you are having a great day.

On Friday I am Lexile testing in my class (computers are required for
this). This week many students have come to class without computers (either
they are damaged or do not have one yet). Additionally, in talking with a
teacher on my team today, he mentioned many computers students did not
connect to the testing site.

I really want to be proactive about this for Friday. Is there a chance I
could reserve 10-12 loaner computers for Friday, 9/17?  I want to ensure I
have a back-up solution so I do not have to send handfuls of students to
the office during class. What are your thoughts on this? I also CC'd Janna
here to see if this would be allowed.

Thank you so much!

6201141,Muchin,Computer problem,"Hello Marco,

Hope your day is going well, just sending the quick email you told me to
send.

My issue: Tried restarting my computer and it took over 10 minutes to
""restart"". It did not restart, instead it troubleshooted itself and showed
the QR code.
I then was able to turn on, and when I did the weird pop-up showed up. It
also showed up for Ms.Melo
 which read:
dma protection - a device attempted to access memory that it was not
allowed to access.

I have updated my computer like you said to try and resolve my issue.
I am available all day, not sure if you even need to look further into it.

Thank you! Hope you have a wonderful day!

I learned today that Mastery Manager pushed out an updated version of their scanning app that is not installed in most of our machines tied to Mastery Manager scanners. Can IT leads please update this app so that pretest scanning goes smoothly? Or is there a way for it to be pushed out centrally? Most campuses are testing tomorrow and Friday (and Bulls and TNA tested today). I’m not sure if it’s different campus to campus but the correct version at Bulls was SmartScan 1.3.2.10 64 bit, and the update is available on the Mastery Manager downloads page. I’m sorry for the fast turnaround but I just learned of this issue.

I made a purchase on Teacherpayteachers, which is a safe website for
teacher materials and lesson plans. One of the files was a zipfile which
kept saying it could not download because ""Failed-Network Error."" I tried
to download it several times until it told me I didn't have permissions. I
have ordered so many things from that website, and have downloaded things
from multiple websites and never have had that problem. When I was finally
able to unzip the file, it created HTML Chrome files, but kept telling me
""Windows cannot complete the extraction because the destination file could
not be completed.""

In addition, anytime I try to stream something, it stalls and buffers
continuously. I've never had that happen before. Others listen to music on
their computers with no buffering.

Also, there is a delay when I try to get to websites. This is also
happening when I am here after hours and no one else is here.


Besides all that, my space bar is not working on my computer, and neither
is my mouse.

Monday morning (9/13), I'll be doing an activity with my seniors in Room
215 that requires them all to have functioning Chromebooks. Would it be
possible to have a tech person in my classroom during Crimson 1 (8:50am -
9:52am) to help me with any tech related questions? This would allow me to
tackle any tech issues for my later classes that day that will do the same
activities.

6200191,Hansberry,Computer Lost- AP,"Hey Veleta,

A student  Alicia Parker- 50316317- lost the computer she received during
the pandemic and was unable to locate it for school.

They are in the Students in Temporary Living Situations Program and going
between hotels and family in doubled up situations.

The Aunt confirmed after I asked to try to locate the computer that she was
unable to do so and hadn't had it since last school year.

The student is pretty anxious about the situation as she knows she needs it
for class.  Let me know how I can help or if you need anything else.

Thank you as always! And sorry to interrupt earlier.

~Cohen

6199920,,Printer Installer Chrome,"Hello,

When trying to install printers, I get a message pop-up saying: You do not
have the Printer Installer Chrome extension installed. I then log in and
get a pop-up stating that the installer is being installed but nothing ever
happens after that. I’m not sure how long it’s supposed to take but it’s
been hours.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Subject: WIDA AMS Updates

 

Hi Veleta,

 

Happy Wednesday!  

 

I need to have at least one cart of chromebooks updated with the new WISA AMS software.  I cannot complete the screeners (due by 10/1) or the ACCESS testing (done in semester 2) until the chromebooks receive the update.   

 

I have no preference on which cart of chromebooks gets the update, I just need to know which one so I can ensure that is the one I reserve for testing.   

 

Directions can be found here to update software on Windows <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vxGNMZ7K_LGg_vD8fzV9BjtoUShzQMy6/view?usp=sharing>  and Chromebooks <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Prz3johQPeVCAiOGOL-Z0vjkzuhHk7QtQA3kYQSFFRk/edit?usp=sharing> .

 

Thank you so much and please let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything I can do to help.

Can you provide a one-pager refresher on how to set up your room phone

Hi there,


We have been thinking about changing the format for our mainline
(312-521-5287 line) calls for next year. We want to give callers options
when they call the mainline for NST to serve our stakeholders better. Not
immediate right now. I would like to have it all finalized *by August 1*,
if possible. People will leave a message or someone from any of those
team's direct lines will answer? These are just the preliminary stages. How
can I go about that? Please see the below examples:


Option 1-Enrollment-1-833-Be Noble

Option 2- Careers office

Option 3- Human Ressources Team

Option 4- Finance Team-Administration

Option 5-Technology-Vendors line to leave a message -someone will check it
.regularly

Option 6- Schools- Campuses- Alphabetical order for the caller to press
options? I don't foresee 18 different options, but I am sure we will
develop a great idea.

**Raise a concern or to speak to someone at NST Main Office press 0

I am copying Tony; I think this might include certain teams and
collaborations. It will change certain norms around to serve our students
and our community better.


Thank you,

I have a couple of questions.

*Extensions: *
Is this something that you keep track of and that you could share?

*How to docs.:* I have a list of staff and their rooms if that helps I can
share it but I really need to know what extensions are assigned to their
rooms and ensure that the correct names or access is shared.  Also, not
sure if you have instruction/how to's that  you can share so that we can
pass that along to our teachers? I know the phone system may be different
but that's a place to start.

I'm the new ELA hire for DRW. My computer is still acting very strange, so
I was wondering if you could check it out for me. The black screen appears
for about two minutes when I log in on the laptop before the home screen
pops up.
This also happens when my laptop falls asleep which is a problem I would
like to fix but cannot. The reason I can't is because the start tab and
search bar will not let me click on them. It's making it really difficult
for me to get things done because anytime that I'm not using the laptop, it
falls asleep right away and then the black screen situation happens all
over again.

Also, who would I contact to help me set up PowerSchool? I tried to log in
and it wouldn't let me. This will be useful for the first day of classes.

Thanks in advance!

6198374,Johnson,Student Chromebook sign out when idle,"Hi Ms. Brewer.  Since we moved to a 1:1 chromebook system, I was thinking
it may be good to consider changing the auto logout settings for student
chromebooks.  Since students are using the same chromebook all day, it may
be good to allow them to stay signed in even when closing the lid between
classes.  Last spring, I saw a lot of students walking around with their
chromebooks open to avoid being logged out.

Thoughts on this?  I would suggest that the chromebook sleep and lock when
the screen is closed but not log them out.

6197862,Hansberry,Youtube Account Access,"Hello Veleta,

I received this email from YouTube and thought I would send it to you as it
is likely the reason myself and other teachers were unable to access
certain videos last school year. I'm hoping we will be able to figure this
out so that it doesn't impact the content that we use in our classrooms.

Thanks so much,

Christine Saltsider


Hi Christine,

?

We’re reaching out because you use YouTube at school with a Google Workspace
for Education
<https://notifications.google.com/g/p/AD-FnEyc-hYGrGX6ASNbVhWrnOwWl9YPOr_hQPvp_95fQUfXfNLNSYLe5-ZjNUimojSnH8lHAQKu3-nqsEkGE2Svw9Q7pTddcYBk907Fu0Ot-qtV1shQoI8kke9C97DYVcRgs18ww9OdHrZd8KRIJCGVMkcmjDqL3jwxBgoXGlI>
account.
In this type of account, you use your school email address, and your school
administrator
<https://notifications.google.com/g/p/AD-FnExiqNZEePvdCVl6GgvwnSEHTsfjSJQMmuymIhalC5ARKkK9dLGXzmpTw-9o7cPRbge9uOc2yPf6jeHW49HT3FSB4NxVDDLPftI9iuJBGS7DkSetZtYSzvTLpn2koMYfbGpc12qa>
manages
your access to Google products like YouTube.

?

*Starting in the coming weeks:* Because your school admin has marked you as
under 18 years old, *you’ll see a new, limited version of YouTube designed
for schools when you use your school account*. This means you won’t be able
to do things like comment, live chat, or receive most notifications
<https://notifications.google.com/g/p/AD-FnEwnrywnQe5xmW_U2V48fo5MTGSeyAhZ-ZJofUBEyNnpkzLqe4M9sLckHNz99nfIt8JeHx1ARf78W5CYGia2c6RxDaJCeYSwmG-hHNLylBKRzowWggg9aGpAftUrar9dRPvCjA>.
You also won’t be able to create YouTube videos and may not be able to
watch certain videos.

?

This new experience is automatically given to students marked as under 18.
But this only impacts your YouTube experience on your school account and *does
not impact the YouTube experience on your personal account*.

?

If you have uploaded videos to your school YouTube account, your channel
will be hidden. You can download and save your videos using Google Takeout
<https://notifications.google.com/g/p/AD-FnEyCcZd1vWsjqxVfwQicD7vCLEZdBiFjfH6oWQ1HXCc72fe_TeDjWXtqJJoskfGUIxtciEF5V2wwS6iwFBRr4rv2p7bk75k0LJQvDJOwg5M>
(when
turned on by your admin).

?

In the coming months we will also be launching a tool that will allow you
to directly move videos from your school account channel to a personal
account. We will reach out with more details when the tool opens.

?

For more info on your school YouTube account, please visit our Help Center

I hope you all had a wonderful weekend! As you may be aware, the DACA

provide a secure and anonymous space for our families to receive answers
from pro bono lawyers.

As always, thank you for your support!

I hope that you are enjoying your weekend. I submitted a ticket the other
day, but I think I found that the issue is different than what I previous
thought. I've broken down the issues that I have founds.

*Issues with RCP Student Logins*

Issue #1 - On the Class 2025 tab here
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MxG04g5l450dGmEldhDWhMm_fnw-N5Ztgm917M8awrY/edit#gid=917975828>,
we have a bunch of students without emails or password.
Issue #2 - On the Class 2025 tab here
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MxG04g5l450dGmEldhDWhMm_fnw-N5Ztgm917M8awrY/edit#gid=1610681004>,
there is no user name listed. Instead, we have something called CB Asset#.
What is that?
Issue #3 - Transfer students are not listed here
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MxG04g5l450dGmEldhDWhMm_fnw-N5Ztgm917M8awrY/edit#gid=970352974>
.
Issue #4 - Advisor fields are wrong for many students on all tabs here
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MxG04g5l450dGmEldhDWhMm_fnw-N5Ztgm917M8awrY/edit#gid=970352974>(it
looks like they never get cleaned up.

*Issues with Quick Export Fields (see attached file)*
Issue #1 - Attached spreadsheet has a student who doesn't have a web ID
Issue #2 - Attached spreadsheet shows students who have nothing come up for
the quick export field of ""Student_Web_Password""
Issue #3 - This may not be an issue, but a handful of students who are
intercampus transfers have passwords related to their last campus when I
pull Student_Web_Password. They are in a separate tab. Can you please
confirm if these are correct?


General Question: If a student's powerschool and email password the same?

dropping and then at some point later comes back. It’s staying connected to

6197276,DRW College Prep,Email Distribution List Update,"Hey Josh,

Per our conversation this week, here
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XdEdBIKgWjcXNpmt0-vDIQKTYKC-VUBPO2hw5zLkwE4/edit#gid=440591304>
is the spreadsheet to update the email trees. Meredith was on PTO today so
she will update her team on Monday by noon. Additionally, I am not sure if
DaLisa and Jamie, also cc'ed, were able to complete their teams.

Jamie and DaLisa, please reply confirming when your lists are updated.
Please try to get it updated by Noon Monday, so that we can ensure that all
of our staff members are receiving emails!

In the meantime, let's update the trees for what is represented in the
sheet as of now. Once everything is updated, as we discussed, please
unhighlight and unbold everything to represent it has been updated.

Have a great weekend!

I need my projector (room 206) turned 90 degrees to the right to face

right into the bookcase? (not the biggest priority)

I hope you are doing well! I apologize for bothering you with some

you know, our College Team moved to room 100.

1. We noticed that the power cords for my computer monitor and for all the
classroom printers are missing. Would you be able to help us either locate
or replace them?

2. The outlet behind my desk (behind the teacher desk closest to the
closet) doesn't seem to be working. Is there a way to check to see if that
can be fixed?

Thank you!

Welcome to the OC!

I received a new computer during remote learning, so I'm not connected to
any printers in the building. I tried adding them with no success, and I
know I will have to print several documents in the morning for my
presentation. Will you be around tomorrow morning to help me out? I will be
in Burnside by 8am and our sessions don't start until 9. Or maybe this is
something you can add remotely. My Team Viewer ID is 193 296 345.

Thanks,

the STLS thing back with the up front staff to lockup because I didn't want

6194507,Pritzker,Monday Morning Tech Support,"Hi Hector,

Can you meet Carrie on Monday at 9:00 in the cafe? We need help setting up
the swivel camera, lapel mic and just making sure we're set to go with
tech. Our PD starts are 9:00 most days, but at 9:30 on Monday. If you can
just kind of be available for the week of the 23rd and the 30th around 8:45
for tech issues that might come up that would be great.

Thanks!

If the repair protocol allows it, I am more than willing to take the device to the Apple Store myself for an LCD replacement.

6194365,,SRI (Scholastic Reading Inventory),"Hey team,

So in the transition from Sean to Friendella, I think we might have missed
the ordering of the Lexile testing online software for this school year.
I've cc'ed Mann and Hernandez on this email because we are signed up for a
literacy pilot and I want to make sure we aren't double ordering this
software.

We are planning on having all our students this year take a lexile test
sometime this year, but most urgently we have our 9th grade students slated
to take the test on September 7th in the afternoon. Gives us three weeks to
get it purchased and up and running, and if I remember correctly this is a
very doable deadline.

Mann and OB, can you double check to make sure the websites below are the
ones that we used last year with Forester and that we haven't already
purchased? I believe to be the website we used last year:
https://www.hmhco.com/programs/reading-inventory#overview

Friendella, once Mann and OB gives us the green light that this is the
correct program, can you fill out this contact form about a quote and they
will follow up <https://learning.hmhco.com/contact-us-reading-inventory> and
get us in the processes of purchasing and getting the information up and
running. We should be able to purchase this, upload a roster of our
freshmen students, and then generate usernames and passwords that we can
mail to kids. Once you get in contact with someone and get it purchased, I
can help you with pulling a roster of 9th grade students.

We need to have this thing up and running by September 7th, so please reply
all to keep everyone up to date.

-Steve


P.S. This is a copy of the form from the AP at Rauner and I know this was
the same type of software we used last year for reference.

Happy August.  Hope you've been doing ok.  I wanted to reach out in

In getting ready with returning back to school- Erin and I will be sharing
RM 159 as our main office space for the two of us and then taking turns
with the interns for RM 116 which will also be our Calm Room for students.
Is it possible to set up and move the printer to RM 116 between now and
when school starts?

I'll be at the school again this week to work on clearing some space for
the printer in RM 116 so it's an easy set-up.

Let us know if you need anything else regarding set-up.

Thanks, as always, Veleta!

6194079,Pritzker,Pritzker Google Log-In Question,"Hi -

Does the school’s handbook / IT policy restrict us in any way from logging into services related to our work with our G-Suite login.

Specific actual example- a colleague sent me a dropbox link with curriculum content. But to access that, Dropbox requested access to download all of my contact information from my Pritzker g-suite account. I know that at my schools in New York, that included student contact info, and that would be a problem. I don’t know what the situation is here.

(1) Can I log-in to whatever I want with my G-suite login?

(2) if the answer to question (1) is no, what are the restrictions?

Would it be possible to get edit access to a Google calendar invite created

conference, and another link to the training slides

Can you help? Below is a screenshot of the invite. Thank you!

6193937,Comer,iPhone stolen,"Hello!
I went to the car dealership for service on Monday, and I am pretty sure my
iPhone was stolen from my car. I used the 'Find Your iPhone' app and it was
located at the dealership, but when I called to ask about it, everyone said
nobody has turned it in. I didn't have it with me when I waited for service
on my car, which is why I believe that it was in my car and was then stolen
(i.e. ""found"" and not turned in). The app is still tracing it there. What
are next steps?

Thank you!

6193933,DRW College Prep,Padlet Subscription,"Hey Kye-Anne & Joshua,

I am looking to purchase a subscription to Padlet. At first, this was
something that would come out of the Student & Culture support budget (with
Justin, myself, and Quinton being users). However, after hearing a few folx
in our L-Team meeting express interest in using Padlet this year, I am
wondering if we can purchase a school wide subscription that would not hit
the student culture and support budget, but that would allow all of
our teachers access to creating pro accounts with unlimited Padlets.

Here <https://padlet.com/premium/backpack>is where you can see an overview
of Padlet. Here <https://padlet.com/premium/backpack/pricing> is where you
can find the information about pricing. Here
<https://padlet.com/premium/backpack/quotation> is where you can request a
quote.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns!

I use a bluetooth mouse with my Noble computer and a couple of days ago, it

First, I heard you're leaving Noble. Congratulations! We will seriously

Estrella Arauz had a hard time joining a zoom meeting with me today, and I
realized it was probably because she needs to set up her TNA zoom account.

We have a few changes to the phones.

We would like the phones to stay on the cellphones for the summer
Monday-Friday July 7th-August 20th 8:00 am-2:00 pm.

*August 23rd -27th*  - on the cellphones from 8:00am - 4:00pm.

*August 23, 2021* - Phones off for all school PDs.

*August 25, 2021* - Phones off for Network PDs at 12:00pm-4:00pm

*August 30, 2021* - we would like the school's phones to be turned back on
Monday-Friday, 8:00 am-4:00 pm.

Herika also wants to keep google voice and not discount the services.

6193588,Mansueto,computer auto turns on...programming?,"Morning friend,
I've been working with the microsoft support for my surface book for a bit,
but there is an interesting glitch that has been occuring with this
computer that didn't happen on the previous one (which I owned
independently). The computer automatically restarts every time I turn it
off. By simply choosing the power --> shut down option it automatically
turns back on as if I chose the restart option. If I push and hold the
power button for the hard shut down option it will stay off for an
undetermined amount of time but then turn back on randomly. This isn't a
terrible problem other than the fact that it completely depletes its
battery in my backpack over the course of several hours and when I pull it
out to use it, expecting it to be fully charged, it is dead. I have been
interacting with Microsoft support to see if they could see any simple
settings that could have been toggled or if when we first got it or if
there was a scheduled restart or anything of the sort but they haven't
found anything. They walked me through the process of fully updating all
the settings and making sure the drivers are all up to date (not just for
microsoft stuff, but also for the uniquely surface programming) and it is
still doing it.
My reason for emailing you this morning is to ask if there is any reason to
think that the program for updating the security software or something else
might be doing this. I haven't logged on with it in over a month and there
is an alert that has been reminding me about (proxy settings?) need to be
updated. Could this cause the pc to restart on its own? Do you have any
idea why this should be happening?

Kind regards,

*Nate *-- can you/Anna take care of the following for the room by Tuesday
noon? It's on your list of to-dos, so should not be new.


   - *Room should be completely ‘clean’ of teacher items (no papers,
   posters, borders, loose items).  *
   - *What remains in room = teacher desk, chair, 25 student desks/chairs,
   bookshelf(s) emptied, file cabinet emptied. *
   - *Remove extra desk/chairs.  Stage on 3rd floor*


*Not on the list: *

   - *The classroom is going to need an extra teacher desk + chair. Can you
   chat with Amy to see which desk you should pull from 311 for Maria
   Figueroa?*
   - *Room 209 and from 308 also need an extra teacher desk + chair. Can
   you chat with Amy to see which desk you should pull from 311 for
   Pallardy/Kent (209) and Carroll (308). *
   - *209 will need students desks and chairs, but I'll let you know where
   to pull from for those.*

6193312,NNST,Zoom Passcode Issue,"Good afternoon!

Our Alumni Career Office uses Calendly so alumni can schedule meetings with
us.  When they do so, it is set to automatically schedule these meetings
via Zoom.  Starting yesterday, we have had issues with alumni accessing the
meetings because a passcode is now required.  However, our invites don't
note what the passcode is.

I went into my Zoom settings and noticed that they have been adjusted so
that passcodes are required, however the option to turn this off is locked
by the admin.

Is it possible to turn that setting off so a passcode isn't needed?  If
not, do you know of other solutions we can take so that we can still
leverage Calendly for alumni to automatically schedule Zoom meetings with
our team?

6193237,,Replacement computer request,"Hi iTeam!

I was hoping to hold off for another year, but I think I probably need to
get a new computer. As you can see from the picture the case of my laptop
has been warping (maybe because I've rarely closed it for the last 1.5
years?) and now there's a permanent open gap under the touchpad.

I was going to work through that, but over the last couple of days there
has been intermittent steady noise coming from the hard drive that makes me
worry that there's a hardware issue pending there. I'm thinking that means
it's time to go for a replacement.

Unfortunately, I don't think I can get by with our standard PC
configuration because of the programming work that I do on my laptop and
would like a replacement to have the following specs:
-i7 or equivalent
-16GB RAM or better
-14"" screen
-3 lb weight or close to it

(This HP zbook that I got in late 2018 has roughly those specs and
generally meets my needs, even with the older i7.)

All of my main files are in a Dropbox folder, so I can manage the transfer
of files to a new computer if you all get it and do the initial setup.

Thanks!

Classroom but didn't get a grade on it (it was 60% of the grade). Would you
be able to reactivate her account (and Google Classroom account) so we can
assess when the project was turned in? The grade in this class is impacting
whether she can stay in the College of Engineering at UIUC or not, and the
deadline is tomorrow?

I would be hoping that at least Laura could get access to KS's account. Is
this possible?

L17
723

Josh, I think. You ended up making the previous meeting rooms (or maybe you sent it to Alberto — I can’t remember). The important thing is I need them to also appear under “My calendars” so that I can manage them and share access as needed.  

Thing #2 - Is there a way to see what other room reservation calendars exist for Muchin? I just want to make sure there are no redundant calendars that could cause confusion.  

Thing #3 - Can you delete all of the chromebook cart reservation calendars. We will only need one of the calendars to reserve the one chromebook cart we will have on campus.  

Thanks for your assistance and let me know if you have any questions!!!

In which we could get rid of the desk phones and everyone just use
their google voice number. I think this would help with staff being more
reachable for parents since they would be able to text them vs just leaving
them a voicemail (that not many people listen to or respond back).

I think implementing a new system will be more efficient going forward.

We can talk more through it, but wanted to throw it out there so you could
start looking into it.

Thanks.

6192891,DRW College Prep,REQUEST: Spare Computer for R&E Use,"Hi Marco, **ticket requested in BCC**
As discussed can you please repurpose one of the four (4) HP PC's we
located in the Food Services office to be used by Antonia Kitchen for
Recruiting & Enrollment at your earliest convenience. The PC will be used
during recruiting events and by parents when registering students onsite.
A charger (blue tip or USB-C) is also needed as there were none left with
the PCs when we found them.  Feel free to reach out with any questions.

6192890,Rauner,WIFI for Alumni Guests and Printers,"Dear Cris,
Greetings! I hope this email finds you well. I will be having alumni coming
into the building. If they bring their own laptops, can you tell me the
wifi they should use when they are here as well as the username and
password. Some of them are recent grads, but some are older and no longer
have their Rauner email address.
Also, how can I add printers? To my own machine and to theirs in the case
they need to print something while they are here? I tried the printer link
in the Rauner Bookmarks, but no printers were popping up.
Thanks and enjoy the rest of your day!

6192590,,Tech support and DoS Tree,"Hi,

My name is Norma Gutierrez and I am in a new role at NST (Manager of
Student Experience). I am reaching out with a few tech questions:

   - I am using a new computer (a mac) and am downloading apps/programs.
   When I was instructed to enter my password I noticed that my name is
   spelled incorrectly. My name on the computer shows up at ""Norma Gutirrez""
   instead of ""Norma Gutierrez"" (it's missing the e).
   - My manager, Janine Franklin, asked me to log into the Noble Self
   Service Portal but I am unable to do so because I don't know my username or
   password.
   - In my new role I will be supporting DoSs across the network - I need
   my new email address added to the DoS tree and also, I will now be the
   manager of that email tree.

Please let me know if you have any questions and thanks for your help!

Best,

Norma"

Service request for malfunctioning Keyboard on HP Elitebook: only random
letters and characters are functioning.   Laptop is connected to an
external keyboard when in place at home-making it hard to determine when
the issue started. I noticed keys were not working when the unit was
disconnected from the keyboard and I was at school trying to login-in.  I
will be at the school this Friday 7/9 starting at 10am- I can bring the
unit in at that time if acceptable.

Let me know what action or troubleshooting steps I need to take, and I look
forward to connecting.

Kate Westerlund's last day is today. Can we please have her emails
forwarded to my account for a few months? We need the account to remain
active for a bit given Kate's relationship with outside partners and a
number of employees.

Additionally, how and where should she submit her laptop?

Thanks!
Tanya
