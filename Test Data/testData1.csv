6204734,Bulls,Chromebook Chargers,"Good afternoon,

I was wondering if I'd be able to get some more spare chargers in Room 311?
I'm finding that I need more chargers than I have on hand for students with
Chromebooks that have the rectangular/flat port. I only have 3, and would
love 2-3 more if possible!

Thanks,

6204733,,Broken Side Port,"Good afternoon,

THe port that connects the HDMI cord to the projector in my rom is
damaged.  I believe it may have been damaged by a student. The port in
which the HDMI cord goes in is coming out of it's socket. It will not
connect  when the cord is plugged in as I don't think it's physically
connected anymore.

Hope this explanation makes sense!

Best,

I was wondering if you could assist me in room 114. My computer screen
doesn't share screens with the epson. It only shows my desktop but doesn't
let me move anything to the side so it can display on the screen? Do you
know what I can do on my own to fix this?

during first period and a piece of plastic broke off of it. I have it in my
room behind my desk. It looks like it will just pop right back in place and
the chromebook appears to be working just fine.

Another couple of other things. The first floor west printer, as well as
the third copier in the workroom are both out of toner.

Best,

6204197,DRW College Prep,Laptop Lagging,"Hey Josh,

How are you? I'm continuing to have issues with my laptop where the CPU
usage goes to 100% and stays there, unless I close out every Google Chrome
window. The issue makes my computer essentially unusable, as it can't
connect to the internet during these times when it's lagging. I end up just
having to wait it out, which can take several minutes, unless I close out
all of my Chrome windows. See the attached screenshot for what I'm seeing
in the Task Manager.

This issue has bee leading to interruption in completing my duties for
several months now, but especially in the last couple months, the timing
has been poor, since it can happen at any time. Is there anything you can
do to correct this issue?

interferes with her ability to log onto her Zoom for her virtual lesson. I
am not sure if her computer can be looked at perhaps, serviced, or switched
out for another.

In addition, just as a side note, many students are often frustrated with
the internet connection of the loaners from the office. THey experience
similar connectivity issues, and I just wanted to let you know.

because they support multiple schools, don't have Noble work phones, and
don't have dedicated spaces at their assigned campuses, it's difficult for

6203236,Noble,Problems with Impact/SSM Login and use,"Hi Jorge and Tech Team Friends,

I was reaching out to follow up on a conversation that I started with Jorge
in person the other day regarding issues many of us at the OC are
experiencing with accessing SSM/Impact.

Corynn Ginnow and I have both been trying to login over the past few days,
and it seems that depending on the time of day, there are times where we
can't get in.

We also always have to start the process using the BIP-IP Edge Client and
then switch from Internet Explorer to Chrome to be able to access it at all
when it does work.

Also, Corynn Ginnow's laptop has a popup that keeps coming up regularly
from the BIP-IP Edge Client. It comes up a lot even once she closes it
out.  This same issue used to happen on my laptop as well, but now it
doesn't ever come up any more.

There are also times where one of us can log in but the other one of us
can't.  I'm also aware that there are a number of learning specialists who
are struggling to get into SSM/Impact as well.

Can you help us resolve these issues?

Thanks so much,
Josh

Chronic Conditions and PCC Protecting Children. The PCC thing isn't listed.

6203144,Bulls,JS Chromebook Wifi Issues,"Hi David,

We have another student (Jai'Quan Simmons 11) with the same wifi issue as
yesterday. He has a chromebook that will lose wifi connection every few
seconds. I told him to visit the tech depot in the auditorium at the end of
school today. Is that okay? Or should I tell him to do something different?

Thanks for all of your help!

6203138,Golder,Wifi Capability,"Hi Jorge,

Ms. McCabe came in this morning b/c she was running some practice AP exams
that are web-based and many of her students were not able to connect to the
internet or it kept dropping so they couldn't finish the questions.

She is concerned that this issue will continue throughout the year and is
wondering if there anything else that can be done to bolster the Wifi in
rm. 114.

My other question is: is it possible for the admin team to have 2 mifi's
that we can use in case of outages or when we are offsite?  We could then
lend these to instructors such as Ms. McCabe when the internet isn't
working well.

Let me know your thoughts.

Best,
Sarah

6203132,Muchin,Printer Issues,"Hey Marco,

Just reaching out to let you know that the College Team printer in L09 has
been a headache for us thus fsar. The printer has been getting ""jammed""
every time we print something, only allowing us to print one page at a time
before it prompts us to ""unjam"" it. It has been a huge inconvenience.

We're hoping you can take a look at it and, if necessary, provide us with a
printer that allows us to be the most efficient with our time. We print a
lot of college documents as a team so having a printer that operates
effectively is vital to the success of our scholars. Any assistance you can
provide to resolve this issue would be greatly appreciated!

Best,

The College Team

*Thanks for taking my quick call earlier! Like I mentioned on the phone,
CPS will not allow Naviance accounts to be created using personal email
addresses. Instead, we'll have to request that James's email address be
temporarily re-opened so you can reset his PW, then he can log on using
that PW to upload his letters (or your team can do it for him on his
behalf). *

*Please send an email to U-help requesting that James's email be
temporarily re-opened for the purpose of updating his Naviance PW. Share
that you know that I've been in contact with Tony Briscoe for similar
situations at Bulls & Golder. In those cases, the email address was
temporarily re-opened, the dean updated the PW using ""forgot my PW"" and
then the account was closed again. If your tech person has questions, they
can email Briscoe directly.*



*This should take care of it! Let me know if you have any questions or want
me to loop in Briscoe on my end. I'm happy to do it!*
*Thanks,*
*Sarah*

6202727,Mansueto,mastery manager hardware request,"I'm sending this as both an official request and to make sure there isn't a
better option in the classroom. We want to use a scanning daily check quiz
setup for students to have written-on quizzes for both conceptual and
mathematical questions and we've realized that our best option is Mastery
Manager. This program is limited to only specific scanning devices (iOS and
Google) and so we can't use the HP laptops that you provided us.
It would be great if Marquise and I were able to get a pair of chromebooks
for them to be stationed in our room for daily scanning by students when
they finish their quizzes. One caveat is that we would either need access
to the google play account on them or for the ""SmartScan Go"" program to be
installed.

Hope you can help us. I know we're pretty backlogged with getting
chromebooks to kids so please let us know if this can't happen in the
near future.

Thanks,

From the administrator account, it says we have no licenses available.

I will be having students practice co-writer on Monday and I'm wondering if

this week up untill yesterday when I plugged it in and it started making

If we can get that replaced so I am able to present to kids on Monday that

6202176,Butler College Prep,"Network Access Improvement Ticket, Room 279","Hi Bryan,

I was hoping perhaps we could look at finding a way to install something
near my room that might help the network connectivity (Noble Staff Cloud).
There have been numerous times where the connection has loaded slowly, or
has been lost altogether. I believe this may be due to the location of my
office in the far corner of Obama Hall.

A reliable network connection is critical for my role as Special Education
Director, as I will be conducting and facilitating the vast majority of our
IEP meetings virtually. Additionally, I will be using this space to
collaborate with my team of Learning Specialists, academic coaches, grade
level deans, among other admin. There are also various personal development
training videos and collaboration tools that require a strong network and
bandwidth from my office to participate in.

I understand this may take time as you may need to discuss options with
your team. Please keep me updated with how the issue can be resolved.

Thank you!

half the students aren't getting the 'temporary password' email when
clicking 'forgot password'.

As I've told you before, Mimecast has made college counseling very
difficult since we've had it.

6201873,DRW College Prep,Student laptop continuing to have issues,"Good morning:

I have a student,  Justis Bowen, who is continuing to have connectivity
issues in the Think Tank. She is part of a 12th grade dual credit College
Algebra class which has to be accessed via Zoom. She says she keeps getting
kicked out, and the Zoom keeps continually freezing, as well as the rest of
the internet when she is in this room.

I know you came in to help her with this issue yesterday. I'm not sure if
something is up with the connection in the Think Tank, or that's just a
school issue. However, Justis did say the internet is usually okay in her
other classrooms, but it gets worse in here.

Thank you!

Greetings! I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out and ask
about my Adobe subscription. I pay monthly for Adobe XI Pro. Its about
fifteen dollars a month. I use it to help alumni fill out forms and
complete requests that I get for records and other things alumni-related.
The basics I use it for are filling in and signing forms, merging PDFs, and
resizing PDFs to be able to be uploaded to college portals. During the
pandemic, it was very helpful to help alumni complete verification
paperwork via Zoom. I'm wondering if you think I should continue paying the
monthly subscription or if I can get it installed permanently and not have
to pay to use it every month. Enjoy the rest of your day!

6201574,Speer,Urgent Fix - Staff/Student Email,"Hello OB,

Apologies for this Friday email. I was just pulling new staff email
addresses, and I noticed that we have both a student named Omar Hernandez
and a staff member named Omar Hernandez. When I search for the staff
member, his email does not pop up as an option, but the student does. It
looks as if a few staff facing emails have been sent to the student email
address, and I am concerned that we are sending information to the wrong
person. Can we investigate this asap and make sure staff are clear on the
email address that belongs to staff member Omar Hernandez? (Also, if you
could send his email to me, I can't find it anywhere.)

Thank you!

I know whole school is having internet issues, but the students are saying

aren't having any problems other than students chromebooks are not working.
I don't know if there is an internet extender for my room or corner, but so
many students keep telling me that it is ""just my room"" and we are unable
to complete the assignment.

We have a new student joining us! Akayla Franklin is a 9th grader who will
be starting tomorrow, Friday, September 17th. Normally, new students will
only start on Tuesdays or Thursdays, but because we are testing tomorrow,

everyone else.

Teachers- please update seating charts as needed and exempt student from
past assignments.

Garduno and Hodges- This student will be joining your advisory! I would
like their advisory buddy to be Alasia Perkins for the day. They do not
have the same schedule- but please introduce them in AMA and ask Alasia to
help out Akayla if needed. I am putting a copy of their schedule in your
mailbox to give to them their first day in AMA.

Ana- Can you enroll them in PS?

Operations- Can you give them a chromebook on their first day?

Brian- Can you give them PS/Email accounts and share that info with Garduno
and Hodges? Can you also add them to the appropriate grade-level email tree?

I'm reaching out about an inquiry for a chromebook for Ivery Green. He
never received one during virtual learning and I have an extra one from an
advisee that left my advisory. Can I give this extra one to him? He's been
using a loaner chromebook since the start of school so he could really use
it.

Please let me know.
